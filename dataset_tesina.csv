The true pressure in normal skin cannot be measured directly by any of the means hitherto described, because there is insufficient free fluid to make manometric determinations. However, for practical purposes, the intracutaneous pressure has been approximately estimated by introducing into skin exceedingly small amounts of a relatively unabsorbable fluid, a mixture of Locke's solution and a vital dye, and then finding the least pressure required to overcome the resistance of the skin to the passage of this fluid through it at the lowest rate measurable with accuracy by the apparatus at hand. In the present paper measurements of this pressure have been termed the interstitial resistance. In normal skin the interstitial pressure, as estimated by measurements of the interstitial resistance, is low, slightly less, on the average, than 1.7 cm. of water in the skin of the mouse, and less than 3.1 cm. of water in human skin. It remains unchanged in states of active hyperemia. In edematous skin the interstitial pressure can be directly measured by determination of the edema fluid pressure. It has been compared with determinations of the interstitial resistance and found to be only 0.5 cm. of water lower in both the mouse and man. Under the conditions of our experiments, in skin rendered slowly edematous by the introduction of irritant chemicals or their topical application, little rise in pressure took place. On the other hand, in rapidly forming edema of the skin the edema fluid pressure and the intradermal interstitial resistance rose and became great enough to hinder materially the further escape of fluid from the blood vessels. The edema fluid pressure rose in proportion to the rapidity with which the edema formed. When a rapidly formed edema subsided, the edema fluid pressure and interstitial resistance fell, but if inflammation and induration followed later, the interstitial resistance became high again. As these conditions subsided the interstitial resistance fell, at times to normal levels, even in the presence of edema. In mouse skin injured by squeezing according to a standard procedure, with result in pronounced edema, the intradermal interstitial resistance rose within a few hours to levels of 10 to 15 cm. of water. In those instances in which the injury progressed to induration, the interstitial resistance rose to such high levels that it seemed impossible that fluid could continue to escape from the capillaries. Such a state of affairs may be of great importance in determining whether necrosis follows trauma.",1946,EDEMApathology SKINinterstitial pressure TISSUEinterstitial pressure,['Laboratories of The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.'],['eng'],['The Journal of experimental medicine'],['United States'],"[['McMaster', 'P D']]",['Journal Article'],"['EDEMApathology', 'SKINinterstitial', 'pressure', 'TISSUEinterstitial', 'pressure']",40s,30-50s

The correlation between the clinical features and those found on laparoscopy which was carried out almost routinely shows the great advantages of this examination. The authors in their discussion have tried, by analysing groups of symptoms, to show that to make an early correct diagnosis laparoscopy has to be used in a majority of cases. It allows treatment to be instituted quickly and unhesitatingly. Furthermore, it is justified because: It is necessary to find out all lesions that are present and which are unpredictable clinically. It renders it possible to carry out therapeutic manoeuvres (such as cutting adhesions and giving antibiotics locally) and to take swabs for bacteriological examination (this will be discussed in the second part of this article).",1979,Clinical Research Demographic Factors Diseases Endoscopy Examinations And Diagnoses Fertility Fertility Measurements Infections Iud Laparoscopy Nulliparity Parity Physical Examinations And Diagnoses Population Population Dynamics Prospective Studies Research Methodology Studies,[],['fre'],"['Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction']",['France'],"[['Blum', 'F'], ['Pathier', 'D'], ['Treisser', 'A'], ['Faguer', 'C'], ['Barrat', 'J']]","['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']","['Clinical', 'Research', 'Demographic', 'Factors', 'Diseases', 'Endoscopy', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Fertility', 'Fertility', 'Measurements', 'Infections', 'Iud', 'Laparoscopy', 'Nulliparity', 'Parity', 'Physical', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Population', 'Population', 'Dynamics', 'Prospective', 'Studies', 'Research', 'Methodology', 'Studies']",70s,70s-90s

According to information available to date from the Federal Statistics Office in the Federal Republic of Germany, pregnancies are still largely terminated by means of cervical dilatation with Hegar dilatators and subsequent curettage. Almost half of all abortions are performed in young women who have not yet given birth. In a great number of cases these patients have a gracile, rigid cervical os which has to be opened abruptly in a few minutes with Hegar's dilatators, often under asserting quite some force. This can result in lacerations of the cervix, cervical insufficiency, inflammation and cicatrization. The transcervical extraamnial Rivanol instillation seems to be a method for avoiding these early and the serious late complications ensuing. Using this method--an alternative to the Prostaglandine application, with its even more serious secondary effects and contraindications--the highest possible degree of success can be achieved in avoiding cervical injuries and in reducing inflammation in the pelvis minor to a minimum, which could later on lead to sterility.",1978,Abortifacient Agentsside effects Abortion Drug Induced Abortion Induced Clinical Research Family Planning Fertility Control Postconception Prostaglandins Research Methodology,[],['ger'],['Fortschritte der Medizin'],['Germany'],"[['Barthel', 'R'], ['Stockhammer', 'P'], ['Haensel', 'W']]","['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']","['Abortifacient', 'Agentsside', 'effects', 'Abortion', 'Drug', 'Induced', 'Abortion', 'Induced', 'Clinical', 'Research', 'Family', 'Planning', 'Fertility', 'Control', 'Postconception', 'Prostaglandins', 'Research', 'Methodology']",70s,70s-90s

Six of the pelvic abscesses and eight of the unilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses came to pelvic cleanout. Evidence presented documents the serious infection potential that IUD usage entails, the antibiotic and surgical management, the infertility that results, and the mechanism assumed responsible.

Use of laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of acute salpingitis has shown that the signs and symptoms classically ascribed to this disease are not specific to it. Fever, leukocytosis, elevated ESR and adnexal masses or swelling are not necessary to make a diagnosis of acute salpingitis. Lower abdominal pain and adnexal tenderness are the most consistent findings. Microbiologic data obtained by laparoscopy and culdocentesis have raised questions about the role of N. gonorrhoeae in salpingitis and have demonstrated that, as in pelvic infections generally, acute salpingitis is associated with mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacterial flora. Good results in the treatment of acute salpingitis depend upon: (1) early diagnosis, (2) hospitalization and bed rest, (3) the use of antibiotic therapy that takes into account the polymicrobial etiology of acute salpingitis, (4) prevention of recurrent episodes of salpingitis through efforts at patient education and identification and treatment of sexual partners. Most important, we must remember that what is at stake is often the future reproductive potential of a young woman. It must be weighed against both patient and physician convenience and cost.

The capacity to bind (3H)oestradiol-17B did not appear to be related to the growth characteristics, time of appearance after DMBA administration, or time between ovariectomy and assay for specific oestrogen-binding proteins. Furthermore, different tumours appeared to have oestrogen-binding capacities unrelated to the percentage of neoplastic cells within the tumour, amount of inflammation, mast cell infiltration, or the presence of fluid-filled cysts. The only morphological features which appeared to be correlated with oestrogen-binding capacity were the number of mitoses and the lipid content of the tumour; that is, the oestrogen-binding capacity tended to be lower in tumours with moderate or large numbers of mitoses and in tumours with much lipid in the epithelial cells.

A single postnatal androgen injection in oily solution influences only the female function; estrogen or the combination of androgen and estrogen are effective in both sexes preventing the ovulation or damaging the testicles. If the hormone is administered in water instead of oil, several injections are necessary in order to obtain an effect. Only the aqueous solution of clomiphene produces a positive effect even given in a single injection. When a single postnatal injection is effective the same result can be obtained after prenatal administration but only following intraamniotic injection. Clomiphene is an exception to this rule; intraamniotic injection has no effect. These observations permit the following conclusions: 1. It is possible to influence the hypothalamus-hypophysis function not only in the first days of life but already in the prenatal period. 2. As androgen damages only the ovary, estrogen however the gonads of both sexes, the mechanisme of action can not be the same. Androgen alters the function of the sexual centres in the brain only in the female rat, estrogen paralyses this function in both sexes. 3. Prenatal injection of hormone is only effective if administered intraamniotically (eliminating in this way the action of the placenta). This proves the important role of the placenta in the metabolisme of the hormones. 4. Other possible consequences of postnatal androgen administration as permanent obstruction of the vagina or hypertrophy of the clitoris can be obtained equally by prenatal intraamniotic injection. These phenomena can also occur independent of the avarian processes, being due to direct hormonal action. 5. Tubo-ovarian inflammation and abscesses are observed with relative frequency especially following estrogen or clomiphene-administration. The cause is unknown but we can assume that circulatory disorders in the genital area, produced by the hormone, are responsible for the frequency of these phenomena.",1976,Androgensside effects Animals Laboratory Biology Central Nervous System Clinical Research Clomipheneside effects Congenital Abnormalities Diseases Embryo Endocrine System Estradiolside effects Estrogensside effects Fallopian Tubes Family Planning Fertility Agents Fetal Membranes Fetus Genitalia Genitalia Female Genitalia Male Hormones Hypothalamus Neonatal Diseases And Abnormalities Ovary Physiology Pregnancy Reproduction Reproductive Control Agents Research Methodology Testis Testosteroneside effects Tubal Effects Urogenital Effects Urogenital System Vagina,[],['ger'],['Archiv fur Gynakologie'],['Germany'],"[['Fels', 'E']]","['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]","['Androgensside', 'effects', 'Animals', 'Laboratory', 'Biology', 'Central', 'Nervous', 'System', 'Clinical', 'Research', 'Clomipheneside', 'effects', 'Congenital', 'Abnormalities', 'Diseases', 'Embryo', 'Endocrine', 'System', 'Estradiolside', 'effects', 'Estrogensside', 'effects', 'Fallopian', 'Tubes', 'Family', 'Planning', 'Fertility', 'Agents', 'Fetal', 'Membranes', 'Fetus', 'Genitalia', 'Genitalia', 'Female', 'Genitalia', 'Male', 'Hormones', 'Hypothalamus', 'Neonatal', 'Diseases', 'And', 'Abnormalities', 'Ovary', 'Physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproduction', 'Reproductive', 'Control', 'Agents', 'Research', 'Methodology', 'Testis', 'Testosteroneside', 'effects', 'Tubal', 'Effects', 'Urogenital', 'Effects', 'Urogenital', 'System', 'Vagina']",70s,70s-90s

In 2 cases the infection was transmitted from a ruptured appendix. Ascending actinomycosis involving the endometrium and resulting in adnexal abscesses was associated with the use of an IUD in 2 patients. This infection should be suspected in any patient who develops a pelvic abscess with an IUD in place. Culture and histologic examination of tissue removed with the IUD may be a means of early diagnosis. The nature of these infections became apparent only after serious complications developed. Each patient required several surgical procedures. The diagnosis remained unsuspected until repeated laboratory examinations detected the fungus. The difficulty encountered identifying Actinomyces israeli indicates the infection is often undetected.

The study was double-blind and randomized, and the three groups were compared for age, severity of shock, presence of underlying disease, and year of study. In the 86 saline-treated patients, the mortality rate was 38.4% (33/86); in the steroid-treated patients, it was 10.4% (9/86). With MPS the mortality rate was 11.6% (5/43), and with DMP it was 9.3% (4/43). Thus, overall mortality was significantly less in the steroid-treated group than in the control group. Further, there was no significant difference in mortality rate between the DMP- and the MPS-treated patients. In Part II, 328 patients were studied retrospectively. One-hundred sixty were treated without steroid, and 168 were treated with either DMP or MPS.

Unexplained mesenteric infarction prematurely terminated the experiments in animals undergoing assisted circulation. The benefits of corticosteroids in experimentally induced endotoxic shock are clearly demonstrated in these experiments.

Thirteen excision specimens obtained from non pregnant patients served as controls. Foci of ectopic decidua in the mucosa were found in 14.3% of cases in the first group, whereas none was noted in the control group. An inflammatory reaction consisting of edema, hyperemia, and lymphocytic, histiocytic and occasional granulocytic infiltration was noted in 67.6% of patients ligated after delivery. No significant inflammatory reaction was demonstrated in specimens of the control group. In the post partum group the clinical findings and the gross examination of the tubes at the time of operation did not suggest any inflammatory changes.

This study was undertaken to see if prostaglandin F2alpha would oppose the effect of the lactogen on the prostate as it does the luteotrophic action of the hormone on the corpus luteum. When it was found instead that the PGF increases steroid binding and that its interaction with lactogen was neither antagonistic nor additive, attention was directed to further characterization of prostaglandin's effect. A dosage/response study of F2alpha alone showed that concentrations of 4 ng/ml and 40 ng/ml increased binding but that 400 ng/ml did not. Glands with stromal hyperplasia and/or inflammation were not responsive than those with epithelial hyperplasia. Assays of water extracts of the tissue revealed concentrations of about 340 ng of F2alpha per gram fresh weight and that the concentration varied inversely as the beta-glucuronidase activity. If the enzyme level is considered an index of the epithelial cell density within the specimen, the inverse relationship suggest a non-epithelial (stromal) site of prostaglandin concentration.",1975,Androgens Biology Endocrine System Examinations And Diagnoses Genitalia Genitalia Male Histology Hormones Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses Laboratory Procedures Physiology Prostaglandinsanalysis Prostaglandinsside effects Prostate Testosterone Urogenital System,[],['eng'],['Prostaglandins'],['United States'],"[['Farnsworth', 'W E'], ['Wilks', 'J W']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]","['Androgens', 'Biology', 'Endocrine', 'System', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Genitalia', 'Genitalia', 'Male', 'Histology', 'Hormones', 'Laboratory', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Laboratory', 'Procedures', 'Physiology', 'Prostaglandinsanalysis', 'Prostaglandinsside', 'effects', 'Prostate', 'Testosterone', 'Urogenital', 'System']",70s,70s-90s

Twelve patients were so affected, of whom six died, a mortality rate of 50%.

In normal animals the response by polymorphonuclear leukocytes began within a few minutes after inoculation, increased rapidly in extent and intensity and reached its peak within 6 to 12 hours. By that time there was also early proliferation of fibroblasts and of large mononuclear cells and these cellular reactions, together with the accumulated granulocytes, began to produce a demarcation of the lesions. Beginning 4 to 6 hours after inoculation the fungus showed some growth but this remained confined to the necrotic center of the lesions. In the diabetic rabbits the onset of the response by polymorphonuclear leukocytes was delayed by several hours, reduced in intensity and was apparently less effective. There was no proliferation of fibroblasts and the lesions were spreading rather than circumscribed. Fungus growth in the tissues began shortly after inoculation, was marked, progressed rapidly, and soon extended beyond the site of inoculation. The large mononuclear cells, however, appeared at about the same time and in equal number in the lesions of both diabetic and non-diabetic animals and showed no morphologic changes. It is concluded that a significant delay and impaired effectiveness of the response by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, a lack of fibroblastic proliferation and an enhanced growth of the fungus lower host resistance to infection with it and are directly consequent on severe alterations in host metabolism.",1959,DIABETES MELLITUSexperimental MYCOSESexperimental,[],['eng'],['The Journal of experimental medicine'],['United States'],"[['SHELDON', 'W H'], ['BAUER', 'H']]",['Journal Article'],"['DIABETES', 'MELLITUSexperimental', 'MYCOSESexperimental']",50s,50-70s

The turnover of plasma albumin is greatly accelerated but the globulins, excluding fibrinogen, show little change during the acute stage of the sterile inflammation. Fibrinogen shows very rapid production and utilization during acute inflammation. Large amounts of C(14) are incorporated in fibrinogen within a few hours after ingestion of the labeled material. The labeled fibrinogen largely disappears within 2 to 4 days after its production. The appearance of C(14) in new red cells from labeled protein or amino acid sources is reduced by inflammation-evidence of impaired synthesis. The pus of the sterile abscess contains a good deal of C(14) activity which at times is as much as that found in the liver. Pus cell C(14) activity per milliliter is similar after injection of labeled plasma and ingestion of labeled plasma or lysine. However, the pus cell fraction contains 3 to 4 times more C(14) activity per milliliter than does the supernatant fluid when the isotope is fed. In the supernatant fluid the activity is all within precipitable protein, much of which is probably derived from the blood plasma. In spite of increased loss of C(14) as CO(2) in the expired air and in the pus, there is evidence of conservation of protein-building materials for maintenance of new plasma proteins and tissue proteins in the more active organs (e.g. liver)-a shift of protein C(14) from the less active tissues (muscle and skin).",1953,ABSCESSexperimental BLOOD PROTEINS,[],['eng'],['The Journal of experimental medicine'],['United States'],"[['YUILE', 'C L'], ['LUCAS', 'F V'], ['JONES', 'C K'], ['CHAPIN', 'S J'], ['WHIPPLE', 'G H']]",['Journal Article'],"['ABSCESSexperimental', 'BLOOD', 'PROTEINS']",50s,50-70s

In the initial standard protocol, groups were housed in single rooms, with each room occupied by a different group after daily cleaning. In the experimental protocol, animals were housed in two-room suites dedicated exclusively to the resident group. This protocol was meant to reduce enteritis due to communication of Shigella flexneri across groups. Isolation of groups was coupled with the doubling of available space in an attempt to reduce stress. Under a final compromise protocol, a two-room suite was dedicated to each group, but the group occupied only one room at a time. The compromise protocol maximized isolation and reduced the available space to the level under the standard protocol. Thus, the study involved two main factors, the degree of group isolation and the amount and configuration of physical space available to each group. Under the experimental conditions enteritis increased, other communicable diseases did not decrease, and trauma from fighting increased by over 45% even though more space was available.

Potential risk factors for nonmenstrual TSS were compared for 28 patients and 100 age-matched controls. Use of barrier contraceptives was associated with a significantly increased risk of nonmenstrual TSS, with matched odds ratios of 10.5 and 11.7 for contraceptive sponge and diaphragm use, respectively. Use of nonbarrier contraceptive methods was unrelated to nonmenstrual TSS. Despite the elevated odds ratio, the incidence of nonmenstrual TSS in barrier contraceptives users and the risk of nonmenstrual TSS attributable to barrier contraceptive use are low.

No cases of cervical neoplasia or endometrial carcinoma were encountered, even after continuous use of the device for 15 years. Dysplastic cervical smears were, however, found in 45 postinsertional smears, and endometrial hyperplasia was detected in seven aspirates; in no cases was the dysplasia or hyperplasia higher than of moderate degree. Thirty-nine of the 45 women with postinsertional dysplastic smears were followed for 3-4 yr; in no case did the lesion progress to a higher grade or to frank malignancy. However, persistence and recurrence of dysplasia were seen in 10 women, necessitating removal of the IUDs. The incidence of cervical dysplasia and endometrial hyperplasia was found to be much higher when the IUDs had been changed than when the original devices were worn continuously. The rate of removal of IUDs because of persistent or recurring dysplasia was also much higher in the former group. Since no pregnancies were reported in any of the women wearing the original device for as long as 15 yr, we do not advocate the practice of changing the device at the end of 3 yr for maintaining contraceptive efficacy as recommended by the manufacturers; instead, we recommend the uninterrupted retention of the original device for periods not longer than 5 yr in view of occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia in two 6-yr wearers.",1989,Age Factors Asia Biology Cervixchanges Contraception Contraception Continuation Contraceptive Methods Contraceptive Usage Cytologic Effects Demographic Factors Developing Countries Endometriumchanges Examinations And Diagnoses Family Planning Fertility Fertility Measurements Genitalia Genitalia Female Incidence India Iud Iud Copper Releasing Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses Measurement Parity Physiology Population Population Characteristics Population Dynamics Research Methodology Southern Asia Urogenital System Uterus,"[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, K.G.'s Medical College, Lucknow, India.""]",['eng'],['Diagnostic cytopathology'],['United States'],"[['Misra', 'J S'], ['Engineer', 'A D'], ['Tandon', 'P']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['Age', 'Factors', 'Asia', 'Biology', 'Cervixchanges', 'Contraception', 'Contraception', 'Continuation', 'Contraceptive', 'Methods', 'Contraceptive', 'Usage', 'Cytologic', 'Effects', 'Demographic', 'Factors', 'Developing', 'Countries', 'Endometriumchanges', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Family', 'Planning', 'Fertility', 'Fertility', 'Measurements', 'Genitalia', 'Genitalia', 'Female', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Iud', 'Iud', 'Copper', 'Releasing', 'Laboratory', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Measurement', 'Parity', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population', 'Characteristics', 'Population', 'Dynamics', 'Research', 'Methodology', 'Southern', 'Asia', 'Urogenital', 'System', 'Uterus']",80s,70s-90s

Premedication hepatic enzyme activity in all monkeys of this study was normal, but increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was found in 4 of the 24 animals 2 weeks after initiation of the study and in 10 of 24 at 4 weeks. A drug-related effect was considered unlikely initially because the increases were not doserelated, and a 3-year review of 655 cynomolgus monkeys revealed a 15-20% incidence of increased hepatic enzyme activity. Good correlation was subsequently established between increased hepatic enzyme activity, active hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, and histomorphologic confirmation of hepatitis (chronic periportal inflammation). Follow-up viral serodiagnostic screening of resident macaques revealed an overall incidence of anti-HAV IgG in 80% (155/193) of cynomolgus and in 70% (14/20) of rhesus monkeys. Serial screening demonstrated that several initially negative monkeys became seropositive for anti-HAV IgG, and a few acquired active infection (anti-HAV IgM). Among newly acquired cynomolgus monkeys, 2.5% (2/80) had an acute HAV infection, and 35% (28/80) eventually tested positive for anti-HAV IgG while quarantined in the primate facility. The characterization of an enzootic HAV infection in incoming monkeys posed a significant risk for the primate colony and handlers. Rigorous sanitation, isolation, and quarantine procedures, including personnel training and additional protective clothing for personnel working in the primate colony, reduced tho potential for transmission and arrested the outbreak.

Data from 90 respondents from 20 countries revealed that use of the word ""cancer"" was often avoided in discussions with the patient. Words commonly substituted for cancer were those that implied a ""swelling"" (e.g., tumor, growth, lump), and ""inflammation,"" or a pathophysiologic change (blood disease, precancerous, unclean tissue). Oncologists estimated that a low percentage (less than 40%) of their colleagues revealed the word cancer in Africa, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Panama, Portugal, and Spain. Oncologists from Austria, Denmark Finland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, estimated the percentage to be high (greater than 80%). However, in all countries, the majority of physicians tell the family the diagnosis. The majority (90%) reported a trend toward increased telling of the diagnosis, due to greater patient information and expectations, and increased physician openess in using the word cancer. Most (68%) felt that the overall effect of revealing the diagnosis was positive. While emotional distress was transiently greater when patients were told, there were positive effects concerning coping, compliance, tolerance of treatment, planning for future, communication with physicians and others, and improved prognosis. The transient negative effects were depression, anxiety, and anger. It is important to recognize that efforts to find the ""correct"" position about revealing or concealing cancer diagnosis must recognize that the language between doctor and patient is constrained by cultural norms. Communication is likely to be far less dependent upon the specific words used then upon the meaning that is conveyed by the doctor.",1987,Empirical Approach International PsychoOncology Society Professional Patient Relationship,[],['eng'],['Cancer investigation'],['England'],"[['Holland', 'J C'], ['Geary', 'N'], ['Marchini', 'A'], ['Tross', 'S']]",['Journal Article'],"['Empirical', 'Approach', 'International', 'PsychoOncology', 'Society', 'Professional', 'Patient', 'Relationship']",80s,70s-90s

From each clinic, we studied a group of women referred for suspected mucopurulent cervicitis and a representative sample of other women attending the clinic. After the women were stratified by patient group and summary odds ratios for all groups were obtained, mucopurulent cervicitis was most strongly associated with the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis; other variables associated with mucopurulent cervicitis included the isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the presence of serum antibody to C. trachomatis, the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use (positive associations) or isolation of yeast (negative association). After adjustment for cervical culture results for C. trachomatis, mucopurulent cervicitis was positively associated with oral contraceptive use (p = 0.02) and isolation of U. urealyticum (p = 0.02) and negatively associated with isolation of yeast (p = 0.03). Among women with a positive cervical culture for C. trachomatis, isolation of U. urealyticum was significantly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis, while among the subgroup of women with a negative cervical culture for C. trachomatis and positive serum antibody to C. trachomatis, oral contraceptive use was strongly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis. These results confirm that in both clinical settings C. trachomatis is the major cause of mucopurulent cervicitis.

Clinical aspects of 300 cases of abortions, the therapeutic effective rate, and the fetal mortality rate of the small doses of Flos Genkwa are similar to those of the routine doses of Flos Genkwa but with fewer side effects.  As compared with the rivanol group, lower the time of induction of abortion is shorter, the rate of live fetuses and the cases with retention of part of the membranes and placenta are fewer.  Pathologic aspects of 100 cases of fetal autopsies -- the predominant pathologic changes of the fetus in the Flos Genkwa group are congestion and hemorrhage in contrast with edema in the rivanol group.  Degeneration and necrosis in visceral organs occurred in both groups, but they were severe in the Flos Genkwa group.  The predominant pathologic changes of umbilical cord in the Flos Genkwa group were trauma and proliferation of intima, thrombosis, and pan-vesselitis.  In the rivanol group, the predominant changes were diffuse infiltration of macrophages in the stroma.  In both groups there was degeneration and necrosis of trophoblasts of placenta.

Apart from tampon use, which was significantly less frequent in TSS women after their acute illness, no demographic differences were observed in the two groups. Significantly lower total aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts were found in TSS women than in healthy controls (P less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). These differences were most profound during the menstrual (aerobes) and premenstrual (aerobes and anaerobes) sample times, whereas no difference in bacterial counts was observed in the mid-cycle samples. Although the less frequent usage of tampons among TSS women after their acute illness might explain the lower aerobic counts in menstrual specimens, this is unlikely to explain the significantly lower aerobic and anaerobic counts observed in premenstrual samples when tampons were not used in either group. It is possible that these differences in the quantitative vaginal microflora were a direct result of recent TSS in these women. Alternatively, disruption of the normal indigenous microflora could have predisposed these women to acute TSS by alteration of the resistance of vaginal colonization to pathogenic microorganisms.",1984,Bacterial And Fungal Diseases Behavior Biology Contraceptive Usage Diseases Equipment And Supplies Examinations And Diagnoses Genitalia Genitalia Female Infections Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses Laboratory Procedures Menstrual Cyclechanges Menstrual Cyclecomplications Menstruation Pelvic Infections Physiology Reproduction Reproductive Behavior Sex Behavior Urogenital System Vaginaanalysis Vaginal Tamponcomplications,[],['eng'],['Infection and immunity'],['United States'],"[['Chow', 'A W'], ['Bartlett', 'K H'], ['Goldring', 'A M']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['Bacterial', 'And', 'Fungal', 'Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Contraceptive', 'Usage', 'Diseases', 'Equipment', 'And', 'Supplies', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Genitalia', 'Genitalia', 'Female', 'Infections', 'Laboratory', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Laboratory', 'Procedures', 'Menstrual', 'Cyclechanges', 'Menstrual', 'Cyclecomplications', 'Menstruation', 'Pelvic', 'Infections', 'Physiology', 'Reproduction', 'Reproductive', 'Behavior', 'Sex', 'Behavior', 'Urogenital', 'System', 'Vaginaanalysis', 'Vaginal', 'Tamponcomplications']",80s,70s-90s

Evolution has selected for interacting systems. When this evolved balance is disrupted, as in autosomal aneuploidy, the organism is generally disrupted.

In 3 cases pregnancy ended with spontaneous abortion, and in 14 cases legal abortion were performed. During the study, regular liver function tests revealed no hepatotoxic effects from DMPA in this group of patients where one would expect a high frequency of a serum hepatitis. Neither coagulation nor blood pressure were affected. The most frequent side effect was amenorrhoea, which seems to be accepted well in this group. Metrorrhagia is often a reason for withdrawing the drug. A very high frequency of venereal or other gynaecological infection is presumably the explanation for the very high number of atypical inflammation cells found at vaginal cytological examination. In the series, two cases of carcinoma in situ have been demonstrated by cervical biopsy.

The past decade has witnessed many advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of PID. It is now evident that such pelvic infections are largely polymicrobial in origin, with major involvement by anaerobic organisms. Salpingo-oophoritis is a part of the spectrum of PID. Included among this group of infections are tubo-ovarian abscesses, traditionally referred to as either gonococcal or non-gonococcal in origin. Within the latter group of infections the importance of anaerobic organisms has also been elucidated. Of particular interest is the reported observation of an increased frequency of salpingo-oophoritis among users of intrauterine devices (IUDs). These reports have noted the specific occurrence of serious pelvic infections due to Actinomyces species, and this will be the topic of the infectious disease conference. Our patient presented with a chronic illness characterized by lethargy, back pain, fever, and anemia; subsequently evaluation disclosed the presence of a large pelvic mass which was confirmed as a tubo-ovarian abscess at surgery.

These are contrasted with an example of the more common upper rectal strictures associated with intraperitoneal sepsis of gynaecological origin, in this case pyosalpynx. Circumferential and transmural spread of inflammation tends to be limited by peritoneal reaction and the resulting strictures (which may be radiologically as severe as those in the mid-rectum) are often readily managed by simple removal of the source of infection.

The rate of inflammatory smears decreases with the increasing interval of time between insertion and cytological examination. IUD typical changes could be observed only in so far as in this group the cytologic signs of chronic cervicitis were increased.

We developed a package of home-based neonatal care, including management of sepsis (septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia), and tested it in the field, with the hypothesis that it would reduce the neonatal mortality rate by at least 25% in 3 years.METHODS: We chose 39 intervention and 47 control villages in the Gadchiroli district in India, collected baseline data for 2 years (1993-95), and then introduced neonatal care in the intervention villages (1995-98). Village health workers trained in neonatal care made home visits and managed birth asphyxia, premature birth or low birthweight, hypothermia, and breast-feeding problems. They diagnosed and treated neonatal sepsis. Assistance by trained traditional birth attendants, health education, and fortnightly supervisory visits were also provided. Other workers recorded all births and deaths in the intervention and the control area (1993-98) to estimate mortality rates.FINDINGS: Population characteristics in the intervention and control areas, and the baseline mortality rates (1993-95) were similar. Baseline (1993-95) neonatal mortality rate in the intervention and the control areas was 62 and 58 per 1000 live births, respectively. In the third year of intervention 93% of neonates received home-based care. Neonatal, infant, and perinatal mortality rates in the intervention area (net percentage reduction) compared with the control area, were 25.5 (62.2%), 38.8 (45.7%), and 47.8 (71.0%), respectively (p<0.001). Case fatality in neonatal sepsis declined from 16.6% (163 cases) before treatment, to 2.8% (71 cases) after treatment by village health workers (p<0.01). Home-based neonatal care cost US$5.3 per neonate, and in 1997-98 such care averted one death (fetal or neonatal) per 18 neonates cared for.INTERPRETATION: Home-based neonatal care, including management of sepsis, is acceptable, feasible, and reduced neonatal and infant mortality by nearly 50% among our malnourished, illiterate, rural study population.

P. falciparum infection has harmful effects in pregnancy, but the effects of P. vivax have not been characterised. We investigated the effects of P. vivax infection during pregnancy.METHODS: Since 1986, pregnant Karen women living in camps for displaced people on the western border of Thailand have been encouraged to attend antenatal clinics. Karen women were screened for malaria and anaemia at each week of pregnancy until delivery, and pregnancy outcome recorded. We compared the effects of P. vivax infection on anaemia and pregnancy outcome with those of P. falciparum and no malaria infection in the first pregnancy recorded at the antenatal clinics.FINDINGS: There were 634 first episodes of pure P. vivax malaria in 9956 women. P. vivax malaria was more common in primigravidae than in multigravidae and was associated with mild anaemia and an increased risk of low birthweight (odds ratio 1.64 [95% CI 1.29-2.08], p<0.001). The birthweight was a mean of 107 g (95% CI 61-154) lower in women with P. vivax infection than in uninfected women. By contrast with P. falciparum malaria, the decrease in birthweight was greater in multigravidae. P. vivax malaria was not associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or with a shortened duration of pregnancy.INTERPRETATION: P. vivax malaria during pregnancy is associated with maternal anaemia and low birthweight.

One of the patients was already on treatment for active pulmonary tuberculosis at the time he was first seen. All had skin eruptions at different stages of development in the area of distribution of the first trigeminal nerve on the affected side of the face and head. Ocular examination revealed impaired vision in the affected eye (between 6/12 and hand movement) in all the patients. All had lid oedema while 5 had ptosis (3 partial and 2 complete). Various degrees of conjunctival injection were observed in all patients while 6 of them had corneal anaesthesia and keratitis. Uveal inflammation, present in all the patients varied from mild iritis in 4 individuals to severe iridocyclitis in the remaining 4. Pupils reacted to light sluggishly in 2 patients while they were dilated and fixed in 3 others. None had any associated abnormalities in the posterior segment. Six of the patients consented and were screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Of these, 4, including the patient with pulmonary tuberculosis, tested seropositive while 2 were seronegative. All 8 were treated with topical acyclovir. This was combined with oral acyclovir in one of the patients. Follow-up period was between 2 and 52 weeks. During this period skin eruptions and anterior segment signs improved in 5 patients while remaining stable in 3 others; post-herpetic neuralgia persisted on the affected side in 4 patients.

All the subjects were enrolled at their first antenatal visit and all delivered at hospital. The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection at first antenatal visit was 35.3% in primigravidae and 13.6% in multigravidae (P < 0.001). Mean haemoglobin concentration was significantly lower in primigravidae than in multigravidae (8.8 v. 9.5 g/dl; P < 0.001). Of the 233 women tested for HIV infection, 18.8% of the primigravidae and 23.7% of the multigravidae were seropositive. At delivery, there was no significant difference in parasite prevalence in peripheral or placental blood between women who had received one or two antenatal doses of SP. The multigravidae who had received two doses of SP had higher mean haemoglobin concentrations than those who had received just one (P = 0.009) [this difference was not seen in the primigravidae (P = 0.92)]. However, linear regression analysis indicated that the haematinic supplements given to the subjects contributed more to this increase in haemoglobin concentration than the SP. The mean birthweights were higher, and incidence of LBW lower in babies born to primi-and multi-gravidae who had received two or three doses of SP treatment than those seen in babies born to women who had had just one dose (P < 0.03 for each). The odds ratio for LBW in primigravidae compared with multigravidae decreased from 3.2 to 1.0 as the number of SP doses increased from one to three. The benefit of three doses (compared with none) was equivalent to the population-attributable risk of LBW in primigravidae being reduced from 34.6% to 0%. Subjects who were seropositive for HIV were twice as likely to give birth to LBW babies as the other subjects. The use of SP was not associated with maternal side-effects or perinatal complications. The present results indicate that multiple doses of SP taken during pregnancy will lead to a highly significant reduction in the incidence of LBW in infants born to primigravidae, even if the women have HIV infections. This reduction is observable even when parasite prevalence at delivery is high because of re-infections in late pregnancy; reduction in parasite prevalence earlier in pregnancy, as the result of SP treatment, leads to improved foetal growth.",1998,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Africa Africa South Of The Sahara Anemia Biology Birth Weight Body Weight Correlation Studies Demographic Factors Developing Countries Diseases Drugs Eastern Africa English Speaking Africa Fertility Fertility Measurements Hiv Infections Low Birth Weight Malaria Malawi Parasitic Diseases Parity Physiology Population Population Characteristics Population Dynamics Pregnancy Pregnant Women Reproduction Research Methodology Research Report Risk Factors Statistical Studies Studies Treatment Viral Diseases,"['Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, U.K.']",['eng'],['Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology'],['England'],"[['Verhoeff', 'F H'], ['Brabin', 'B J'], ['Chimsuku', 'L'], ['Kazembe', 'P'], ['Russell', 'W B'], ['Broadhead', 'R L']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['Acquired', 'Immunodeficiency', 'Syndrome', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'South', 'Of', 'The', 'Sahara', 'Anemia', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Weight', 'Body', 'Weight', 'Correlation', 'Studies', 'Demographic', 'Factors', 'Developing', 'Countries', 'Diseases', 'Drugs', 'Eastern', 'Africa', 'English', 'Speaking', 'Africa', 'Fertility', 'Fertility', 'Measurements', 'Hiv', 'Infections', 'Low', 'Birth', 'Weight', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Parasitic', 'Diseases', 'Parity', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population', 'Characteristics', 'Population', 'Dynamics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant', 'Women', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Methodology', 'Research', 'Report', 'Risk', 'Factors', 'Statistical', 'Studies', 'Studies', 'Treatment', 'Viral', 'Diseases']",90s,90-2010s

Yet, national and international diarrheal diseases control programs are silent about the overlap between these two major public health problems that coexist in most tropical countries. To test the hypothesis that malaria is associated with diarrhea and to define the role of malaria in morbidity due to diarrhea, 522 children 6-60 months of age presenting with acute diarrhea to the Children's Emergency Ward of the University College Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria were routinely screened by means of thin and thick blood films for malaria parasitemia. Controls, without diarrhea, were studied in parallel. Detailed clinical features were recorded for every patient. Sixty-eight (13%) of the 522 diarrhea patients screened had malaria parasitemia. Among the controls (who had similar distributions of admission temperature, hemoglobin types, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and prior treatment with antimalarial drugs), parasitemia was not significantly different, occurring in 56 (17.9%) of 313. In the dry season, however, a significantly higher prevalence of parasitemia was observed among the control group (15.5%) than in the diarrhea group (7.0%) (P = 0.004). Parasitemia was significantly more common in the dehydrated diarrhea patients than their well-hydrated counterparts (25% of 56 versus 11% of 466; P < 0.005). There were no significant differences in admission temperature, the presence of vomiting, or the home use of oral rehydration fluids between the dehydrated and the well-hydrated subsets of diarrhea patients. Consideration of parasite densities did not alter any of the foregoing relationships. These data contradict the widely held view that diarrhea is a symptom of malaria or that malaria causes diarrhea. They do, however, provide support for examining blood smears at least in dehydrated children with diarrhea in malaria-endemic areas and giving immediate antimalarial therapy to those who have malaria parasitemia.",1997,Africa Africa South Of The Sahara Age Factors Case Control Studies Child Demographic Factors Developing Countries Diarrhea Diseases English Speaking Africa Examinations And Diagnoses Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses Malaria Nigeria Parasitic Diseases Population Population Characteristics Research Methodology Research Report Signs And Symptoms Studies Western Africa Youth,"['Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene'],['United States'],"[['Sodeinde', 'O'], ['Gbadegesin', 'R A'], ['Ademowo', 'O G'], ['Adeyemo', 'A A']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]","['Africa', 'Africa', 'South', 'Of', 'The', 'Sahara', 'Age', 'Factors', 'Case', 'Control', 'Studies', 'Child', 'Demographic', 'Factors', 'Developing', 'Countries', 'Diarrhea', 'Diseases', 'English', 'Speaking', 'Africa', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Laboratory', 'Examinations', 'And', 'Diagnoses', 'Malaria', 'Nigeria', 'Parasitic', 'Diseases', 'Population', 'Population', 'Characteristics', 'Research', 'Methodology', 'Research', 'Report', 'Signs', 'And', 'Symptoms', 'Studies', 'Western', 'Africa', 'Youth']",90s,90-2010s

Preclinical and clinical studies show that fish oil supplementation seems able to reduce disease-associated anorexia and body weight loss. This improvement could be due to shifts in metabolism and changes in proinflammatory cytokine production and action. ω-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid, are used as substrates for eicosanoid synthesis, competing for enzymes with arachidonic acid, which is a substrate for the synthesis of proinflammatory immunomodulators, such as prostaglandin E2. Fish oil supplementation is generally found to lower production of cytokines including interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, thereby reducing various immune responses, including inflammation. However, conflicting results regarding the effects of fish oil interventions have been reported. The main factor that emerges from the contradictory reports is the variety of models, assays and methodologies that have been used. This brief review presents an overall perspective on the potential use of ω-3 PUFAs as a nutritional intervention to ameliorate disease-associated and cytokine-induced neurological manifestations.

Between 1993 and 1995, 197 children in southern Cameroon were followed weekly clinically and monthly parasitologically. The dates of first positive blood smear and the evolution of the parasite prevalence rates were compared between infants born to mothers presenting with (n = 42) and without (n = 155) P. falciparum infection of the placenta. Infants born to placenta-infected mothers were more likely to develop a malaria infection between 4 and 6 months of age; then the difference progressively disappeared. Similarly, parasite prevalence rates were higher in placenta-infected infants from 5 to 8 months of age. Thus, malarial infection of the placenta seems to result in a higher susceptibility of infants to the parasite. This was not related to maternally transmitted antibodies, as specific antibody levels were similar in both groups of infants.

AHO always means an emergency with high diagnostic and therapeutic demands. The successful outcome depends on early diagnosis and prompt, adequate therapy. Therefore good cooperation with the pediatricians and radiologists is essential. The principles of treatment are symptomatic measures, bedrest and operative intervention, if necessary, with drainage of pus and débridement of any necrotic material, together with antibiotic treatment in sufficient concentration and for sufficient duration.

The novel formulation was compared with VCF (a currently marketed film also containing N-9). Ten women underwent two baseline cycles of postcoital testing in which no film was used, followed by three test cycles in which Allendale-N9 film, a new film containing either 100 or 130 mg N-9, or VCF containing 70mg N-9 was used. The sequence of testing cycles was randomized. In each cycle, condoms were used prior to midcycle, then a midcycle cervical mucus specimen was examined to ensure midcycle characteristics and the absence of sperm. Each woman then had intercourse using either no film (baseline cycles) or a test film (test cycles) and returned 2-3 h afterwards. Cervical mucus was again assessed for adequacy and the presence of sperm. Each woman also underwent colposcopy using a protocol developed by the World Health Organization. The average number of progressively motile sperm seen per high power field were as follows: average of the two baseline cycles, 19.3; test cycle with Allendale-N9 film containing 100 mg N-9, 0.6; test cycle with Allendale-N9 film containing 130 mg N-9, 0.9; and test cycle with VCF, 0.5. There was no significant difference between baseline cycles or between test cycles in the number of progressively motile sperm per high power field (HPF) seen (p = 0.31 and p > or = 0.50, respectively). The average number of motile sperm seen in each test cycle did, however, differ significantly from the number in either baseline cycle (p < 0.02). The majority of colposcopic examinations were normal. In one baseline cycle and eight test cycles, colposcopy showed superficial de-epithelialization without underlying inflammation. There was no apparent dose response and in all cases the volunteers were asymptomatic.

Babies born during the intervention were also wiped with chlorhexidine.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effects of the intervention on neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.RESULTS: 3635 women giving birth to 3743 babies were enrolled in the intervention phase and 3330 women giving birth to 3417 babies were enrolled in the non-intervention phase. There were no adverse reactions related to the intervention among the mothers or their children. Among infants born in the intervention phase, overall neonatal admissions were reduced (634/3743 (16.9%) v 661/3417 (19.3%), P < 0.01), as were admissions for neonatal sepsis (7.8 v 17.9 per 1000 live births, P < 0.0002), overall neonatal mortality (28.6 v 36.9 per 1000 live births, P < 0.06), and mortality due to infectious causes (2.4 v 7.3 per 1000 live births, P < 0.005).

Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD were not common. In these patients, inflammation was predominantly located in the sigmoid and left colon in UC cases, and in the ileum and colon in CD cases. Treatment with sulphasalazine and corticosteroids was effective in 95% of UC cases; However, about 42% of UC patients showed disease recurrence during the follow-up period of 1.11 years. Five out of eight CD patients had part of their intestine removed, whereas three were treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs or the antibiotic metronidazole.

There are few controlled studies regarding efficacy of this treatment modality. While there are few published reports of serious complications of this therapy, warnings about the hazards of epidural steroid injections occasionally appear in both medical and lay literature. It is the purpose of this review to assess the existing evidence for efficacy of epidural steroid injections for sciatica and to assess the risks of this procedure.DATA SOURCES: Peer reviewed medical literature from 1930 to the present was reviewed in order to survey reports regarding pathophysiology of radiculopathy, mechanism of action of epidural corticosteroids, controlled efficacy studies, reports on series of epidural steroid injections for sciatica, reports of adverse effects of epidural and intrathecal steroid injections, review articles of epidural and intrathecal steroid injections, and studies of the behavioral and histological effects of epidural steroids and their vehicle in animals.STUDY SELECTION: Studies and review articles were selected from Medline search and from the author's files of older literature.DATA SYNTHESIS: RESULTS of this review are qualitative. It was felt that there was insufficient controlled data to analyze efficacy or safety studies in a quantitative fashion.RESULTS: Radiculopathy following disc herniation appears to produce either mechanical or chemical nerve root inflammation. Epidurally injected corticosteroids most likely exert a beneficial effect through anti-inflammatory rather than direct analgesic mechanisms. Most descriptive studies report beneficial effects of epidural steroids in the majority of cases of radiculopathy, but not for other causes of low back pain. Most of the few controlled studies report epidural steroids to be more efficacious than placebo or epidural local anesthetic alone. Most patients who respond favorably continue to show improvement for many months. Several neurologic complications have been reported after intrathecal steroid injections, most following multiple intrathecal injections. Four cases of epidural abscess, one case of bacterial meningitis, and one case of aseptic meningitis have been reported following epidural steroid injections.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the published literature supports the notion that epidural steroids provide relief of pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy. There is anecdotal evidence that multiple intrathecal steroid injections may be associated with neurological dysfunction, but there is very little evidence that epidural steroids are neurotoxic.",1997,Complications Corticosteroids Efficacy Epidural Radiculopathy,"['Department of Anesthesiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuguergue, NM 87131-5216, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal of back and musculoskeletal rehabilitation'],['Netherlands'],"[['Abram', 'S E']]",['Journal Article'],"['Complications', 'Corticosteroids', 'Efficacy', 'Epidural', 'Radiculopathy']",90s,90-2010s

A total of 201 consecutive hospitalized patients were included at the Simao Mendes National Hospital in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Age- and sex-matched controls were selected from an ongoing census in a semi-urban area of Bissau. Among 201 cases with such bacterial infection the prevalence of HIV-1 was 5.4%, HIV-2, 27.9%, and both HIV-1 and HIV-2 reactivity 6.4%. Among controls, the corresponding prevalence rates were significantly lower, 1.5%, 9.0% and 1.0%, respectively. A total of 140, 31 and 30 cases of pneumonia, sepsis and pyomyositis were included, and the differences in prevalence of HIV-2 compared with the controls also remained significant for each diagnosis separately. Lymphocyte subsets were determined in 93 consecutive patients, and the CD4 cell counts and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios were markedly suppressed in the HIV-2-seropositive group. Due to excess mortality in the seropositive groups with sepsis (75.0%) and pyomyositis (25.0%), the mortality during hospitalization was significantly higher among HIV-2 infected compared to HIV-negative patients.

919,8972502,"['Mechanisms', 'action', 'intrauterine', 'devices']","The major effect of all intrauterine devices (IUD) is to induce a local inflammatory reaction in the endometrium whose cellular and humoral components are released into the uterine cavity. This inflammatory reaction has a variable effect on the reproductive strategy of the species studied. For example, this foreign body reaction can be localized within the uterus of rodents; and in farm animals it can have striking extrauterine effects. Thus, the action of IUDs in humans cannot be discerned from animals. In humans, copper ions released from Cu-IUDs enhance the inflammatory response and reach concentrations in the luminal fluids of the genital tract that are toxic for spermatozoa and embryos. In women using the IUD, the entire genital tract seems affected, at least in part, because of luminal transmission of the fluids that accumulates in the uterine lumen. This affects the function or viability of gametes, decreasing the rate of fertilization and lowering the chances of survival of any embryo that may be formed, even before it reaches the uterus. Studies on the recovery of eggs from women using IUDs and from women not using contraception show that embryos are formed in the tubes of IUD users at a much lower rate compared with nonusers. This is believed to be the major action of IUDs. Therefore, the common belief that the major mechanism of action of IUDs in women is through destruction of embryos in the uterus (i.e., abortion) is not supported by the available evidence. In Cu-IUD users, it is likely that few spermatozoa reach the distal segment of the fallopian tube, those that encounter an egg may be in poor condition. Thus, the few eggs that are fertilized have little chance for development and their possibility for survival in the altered tubal milieu become worse as they approach the uterine cavity.",1996,Biology Contraception Contraceptive Methodspharmacodynamics Contraceptive Mode Of Action Endometrial Effects Endometrium Family Planning Genitalia Genitalia Female Germ Cells Implantation Suppression Inhibition Of Fertilization Iudpharmacodynamics Literature Review Physiology Spermatozoa Urogenital System Uterus,"['Instituto Chileno de Medicina Reproductiva, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],['Obstetrical & gynecological survey'],['United States'],"[['Ortiz', 'M E'], ['Croxatto', 'H B'], ['Bardin', 'C W']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']","['Biology', 'Contraception', 'Contraceptive', 'Methodspharmacodynamics', 'Contraceptive', 'Mode', 'Of', 'Action', 'Endometrial', 'Effects', 'Endometrium', 'Family', 'Planning', 'Genitalia', 'Genitalia', 'Female', 'Germ', 'Cells', 'Implantation', 'Suppression', 'Inhibition', 'Of', 'Fertilization', 'Iudpharmacodynamics', 'Literature', 'Review', 'Physiology', 'Spermatozoa', 'Urogenital', 'System', 'Uterus']",90s,90-2010s

We have investigated possible risk factors for pneumococcal disease among children living in a rural area of The Gambia.METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted in which children with pneumococcal infection were identified from among children attending out-patient and under-fives clinics and matched according to age with healthy children selected randomly from the local community. A questionnaire was used to investigate possible nutritional, medical, socioeconomic and environmental risk factors for pneumococcal disease.RESULTS: An increased risk of pneumococcal disease was associated with poor weight gain, a history of serious illness in the previous 6 months, exposure to cigarette smoke or being carried on mother's back while cooking. The risk of pneumococcal disease was reduced among children whose mothers had a personal source of income.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pneumococcal disease could be reduced by improving nutrition and taking steps to identify and rehabilitate those children whose weight is faltering or falling. Encouraging mothers to develop greater financial independence may also be beneficial. Reduced exposure to smoke should be promoted by improving ventilation in kitchens, introducing more efficient and less polluting stoves, keeping children away from smoky environments and discouraging parental smoking.",1996,Africa Africa South Of The Sahara Age Factors Bacterial And Fungal Diseases Behavior Biology Child Demographic Factors Developing Countries Diseases Economic Factors English Speaking Africa Gambia Incomewomen Infant Infections Physiology Population Population Characteristics Pulmonary Effects Research Report Respiratory Infections Risk Factors Rural Population Smoking Socioeconomic Factors Western Africa Youth,"['Research Council Laboratories, Banjul, The Gambia.']",['eng'],['International journal of epidemiology'],['England'],"[[""O'Dempsey"", 'T J'], ['McArdle', 'T F'], ['Morris', 'J'], ['Lloyd-Evans', 'N'], ['Baldeh', 'I'], ['Laurence', 'B E'], ['Secka', 'O'], ['Greenwood', 'B M']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]","['Africa', 'Africa', 'South', 'Of', 'The', 'Sahara', 'Age', 'Factors', 'Bacterial', 'And', 'Fungal', 'Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Demographic', 'Factors', 'Developing', 'Countries', 'Diseases', 'Economic', 'Factors', 'English', 'Speaking', 'Africa', 'Gambia', 'Incomewomen', 'Infant', 'Infections', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population', 'Characteristics', 'Pulmonary', 'Effects', 'Research', 'Report', 'Respiratory', 'Infections', 'Risk', 'Factors', 'Rural', 'Population', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic', 'Factors', 'Western', 'Africa', 'Youth']",90s,90-2010s

Latex condoms for men are the best studied physical barrier and offer high efficacy as both a contraceptive and as protection against several major sexually transmissable diseases (STD), particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Limited acceptability and dependence on male cooperation limit their ¿use effectiveness¿ in non-commercial sex or when the receptive partner is disempowered. Polyurethane male condoms may improve acceptability and prove stronger and more durable. Female-dependent methods require further study which may net real benefits for containing the spread of STD/HIV infections in the short to medium term. Female condoms and newer non-toxic intravaginal chemicals offer much promise. Similarly, the female diaphragm warrants further investigation and should be given more prominence at least as a second-line measure. Withdrawal and post-coital intravaginal chemical prophylaxis may have been previously underestimated as occasionally useful strategies, particularly for reducing the risk of pregnancy and HIV infection for those that were otherwise unprepared for sex. The only role for vasectomy is as a contraceptive measure, while vaginal or anal douching is contraindicated as a reproductive health measure because of the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and other ectopic pregnancy. There is ample room for developing a more diverse range of better barrier products as well as better promoting those methods that already exist.

Whether this association also implies a causality between acute health effects and particle exposure at these low levels is unclear at this time; no mechanism is known that would explain such dramatic effects of low ambient particle concentrations. Based on results of our past and most recent inhalation studies with ultrafine particles in rats, we propose that such particles, that is, particles below approximately 50 nm in diameter, may contribute to the observed increased mortality and morbidity In the past we demonstrated that inhalation of highly insoluble particles of low intrinsic toxicity, such as TiO2, results in significantly increased pulmonary inflammatory responses when their size is in the ultrafine particle range, approximately 20 nm in diameter. However, these effects were not of an acute nature and occurred only after prolonged inhalation exposure of the aggregated ultrafine particles at concentrations in the milligrams per cubic meter range. In contrast, in the course of our most recent studies with thermodegradation products of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) we found that freshly generated PTFE fumes containing singlet ultrafine particles (median diameter 26 nm) were highly toxic to rats at inhaled concentrations of 0.7-1.0 x 10(6) particles/cm3, resulting in acute hemorrhagic pulmonary inflammation and death after 10-30 min of exposure. We also found that work performance of the rats in a running wheel was severely affected by PTFE fume exposure. These results confirm reports from other laboratories of the highly toxic nature of PTFE fumes, which cannot be attributed to gas-phase components of these fumes such as HF, carbonylfluoride, or perfluoroisobutylene, or to reactive radicals. The calculated mass concentration of the inhaled ultrafine PTFE particles in our studies was less than 60 micrograms/m3, a very low value to cause mortality in healthy rats. Aging of the fumes with concomitant aggregation of the ultrafine particles significantly decreases their toxicity. Since ultrafine particles are always present in the urban atmosphere, we suggest that they play a role in causing acute lung injury in sensitive parts of the population.",1995,NASA Discipline Environmental Health,"['Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester, New York, USA.', 'U Rochester, NY']",['eng'],['Inhalation toxicology'],"['United States', 'England']","[['Oberdorster', 'G'], ['Gelein', 'R M'], ['Ferin', 'J'], ['Weiss', 'B'], ['Clarkson', 'T W']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]","['NASA', 'Discipline', 'Environmental', 'Health']",90s,90-2010s

Whether distinct epidemiologic forces among human populations or biologic characteristics of the organism are responsible for the different routes of transmission is uncertain.STUDY DESIGN: To determine if ophthalmia neonatorum and trachoma are linked epidemiologically, 38 infants with ophthalmia and 277 children with trachoma were studied for evidence of C. trachomatis infection using culture, antigen and DNA detection tests. The study was performed in a trachoma endemic area of central Kenya.RESULTS: Of infants with ophthalmia neonatorum, 8% to 9% had microbiologic evidence of ocular C. trachomatis infection.

943,29539051,"['A', 'Proposed', 'Model', 'Linking', 'Inflammation', 'Obesity', 'Diabetes', 'Periodontal', 'Infections']","BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and periodontal disease. Adipocytes appear to secrete proinflammatory cytokines which may be the molecules linking the pathogenesis of these diseases. We evaluated the relationship between obesity, periodontal disease, and diabetes mellitus insulin resistance as well as the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its soluble receptors (sTNFα) to assess the relationship of inflammation to obesity, diabetes, and periodontal infections.METHODS: The relationship between periodontal disease, obesity, and insulin resistance was examined in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). In a population of 12,367 non-diabetic subjects, the variable body mass index (BMI) was used as an assessment of obesity and periodontal disease was assessed by mean clinical attachment loss. The plasma levels of TNFα and sTNFα were assessed in subsets of 1,221 adults from Erie County, New York, who represented the highest and lowest quartile of BMI. These subjects had extensive periodontal and medical evaluations.RESULTS: In the NHANES III portion of the study, BMI was positively related to severity of periodontal attachment loss (P <0.001). Weighted multiple logistic regressions showed that this relationship is likely mediated by insulin resistance, since overweight individuals (with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 ) with high levels of insulin resistance (IR) exhibited an odds ratio of 1.48 (95% confidence interval 1.13 - 1.93) for severe periodontal disease as compared to overweight subjects with low IR. In the Erie County adult population, the highest levels of TNFα and sTNFα receptors were found in those individuals in the highest quartile of BMI. A positive correlation of TNFα levels with periodontal disease was found only in those in the lowest quartile of BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a significant predictor of periodontal disease and insulin resistance appears to mediate this relationship. Furthermore, obesity is associated with high plasma levels of TNFα and its soluble receptors, which in turn may lead to a hyperinflammatory state increasing the risk for periodontal disease and also accounting in part for insulin resistance. Further studies of the molecular basis of insulin resistance and its relationship to diabetes, periodontal disease, and obesity are necessary to fully test the hypothesis that adipocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines is a pathogenic factor linking obesity to diabetes and periodontal infections.",2005,Diabetes TNFalpha insulin resistance obesity periodontal disease soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor,"['Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, and Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Office of Science, Technology Transfer, and Economic Outreach (STOR), University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY.', 'Periodontal Disease Research Center, Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo.', 'Periodontal Disease Research Center, Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo.', 'Periodontal Disease Research Center, Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo.', 'Formerly, Department of Pathophysiology/Periodontal Science, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan; Currently, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University.', 'Retired; formerly, Department of Periodontology and Endodontology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University.']",['eng'],['Journal of periodontology'],['United States'],"[['Genco', 'Robert J'], ['Grossi', 'Sara G'], ['Ho', 'Alex'], ['Nishimura', 'Fusanori'], ['Murayama', 'Yoji']]",['Journal Article'],"['Diabetes', 'TNFalpha', 'insulin', 'resistance', 'obesity', 'periodontal', 'disease', 'soluble', 'tumor', 'necrosis', 'factor', 'receptor']",2000s,90-2010s

Once these two causes of blindness were tentatively differentiated, attempts to restore vision in an eye that had been blinded by a trachomatous membrane over the cornea by instilling gonorrheal pus began to be practiced. In 1841, Joseph Piringer described his use of this method to determine infectiousness decades before the discovery of pathogenic bacteria, as well as ethical concerns about the associated endangerment of patients.

Data included cellular and molecular markers of cytokine and growth factor signaling (phosphorylation and mRNA content) as well as measurements to detect muscle atrophy. IL-6 infusion resulted in muscle atrophy characterized by a preferential loss of myofibrillar protein (-17%). IL-6 induced a decrease in the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (-60%) and STAT5 (-33%), whereas that of STAT3 was increased approximately twofold. The changes seen in the IL-6-infused muscles suggest alterations in the balance of growth factor-related signaling in favor of a more catabolic profile. This suggests that downregulation of growth factor-mediated intracellular signaling may be a mechanism contributing to the development of muscle atrophy induced by elevated IL-6.",2005,Nonprogrammatic,"['Department of Physiology & Biophysics, University of California, Irvine, Medical Sciences 1, Irvine, CA 92697-4560, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)']","['United States', 'United States']","[['Haddad', 'F'], ['Zaldivar', 'F'], ['Cooper', 'D M'], ['Adams', 'G R']]","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",['Nonprogrammatic'],2000s,90-2010s

Since the anti-fat health education initiatives of the 1980s and early 1990s, certain dietary fats have been increasingly recognized as actually beneficial to health. Athletes, like the mainstream populace, are now getting the message that wise dietary fat (triacylglycerol) choices offer essential fatty acids, blood lipid management, maintained endocrine and immune function, inflammation control, metabolic effects and even potential body composition and performance benefits. Toward this end, many companies now sell specialty dietary fat supplements and recognized health authorities have begun recommending them to certain populations. This review will cover data regarding the physiology, dietary needs, food sources, and potential benefits and risks most relevant to athletes. Practical suggestions for incorporating healthy fats will be made. Both food-source and supplemental intakes will be addressed with interrelationships to health throughout.

While SIS has proven to be a useful biomaterial for implants in vivo, problems associated with endothelialization and thrombogenicity of SIS implants may limit its vascular utility. The goal of this study was to determine if the biological properties of SIS could be improved by growing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on SIS and allowing these cells to deposit human basement membrane proteins on the porcine substrate to create what we have called ""conditioned"" SIS (c-SIS). Using an approach in which HUVEC were grown for 2 weeks on SIS and then removed via a technique that leaves behind an intact basement membrane, we hypothesized that the surface properties of SIS might be improved. We found that when re-seeded on c-SIS, HUVEC exhibited enhanced organization of cell junctions and had increased metabolic activity compared to cells on native SIS (n-SIS). Furthermore, HUVEC grown on c-SIS released lower amounts of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin PGI2 into the media compared to cells grown on n-SIS. Additionally, we found that adhesion of resting or activated human platelets to c-SIS was significantly decreased compared to n-SIS suggesting that, in addition to improved cell growth characteristics, conditioning SIS with human basement membrane proteins might decrease its thrombogenic potential. In summary, conditioning of porcine SIS by human endothelial cells improves key biological properties of the material that may improve its usefulness as remodeling scaffold for tissue repair.

On this perspective, feline AGP can be a useful comparative model, as it has different concentrations in cats susceptible or resistant to some disease. As a preliminary approach to the study of feline AGP (fAGP) we have purified this protein from feline serum by HPLC using human AGP (hAGP) as a model. Immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against fAGP and with a monoclonal antibody against hAGP was performed on serum from healthy cats, from cats exposed to feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection and from cats with purulent inflammations, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Immunohistochemistry on tissues from healthy cats and from cats with different diseases (FIP, FIV, FeLV, locally extensive inflammation) was also performed with the same antibodies. Both hAGP and fAGP have been purified to homogenity as determined by SDS-PAGE. fAGP did not react with the anti-hAGP antibody which, in contrast, detected in feline serum a low MW protein that we called fAGP-related protein (fAGPrP). This protein was underexpressed in cats with FeLV and FIP. Both fAGP and fAGPrP were immunohistochemically detected in plasma and hepatocytes with a stronger intensity in cats with FIP and some inflammatory conditions. Moreover, fAGPrP was detected in the cytoplasm of tissue cells, most likely identifiable with plasma cells.

We also used single emission and also dual emission fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy employing pH-sensitive probes to confirm pH heterogeneity. Mean pH measured at 415 points of CEA was 7.55+/-0.32; at 275 points of WHHL rabbit aortas it was 7.40+/-0.43; and in 233 points of HUA it was 7.24+/-0.1. In CEA, pH of yellow (lipid-rich) areas was significantly lower than pH in calcified areas (7.15+/-0.01 vs. 7.73+/-0.01, P<0.0001). The coefficients of variation (heterogeneity) of pH in CEA, WHHL rabbit aortas, and HUA were 0.038+/-0.010, 0.039+/-0.007, and 0.009+/-0.003, respectively (P=0.0001).

While secondary pulmonary hypertension predominantly results from acute or chronic left ventricular failure, characteristic gene defects or predisposing risk factors lead to various forms of primary pulmonary hypertension. Despite its diverse pathogenesis, pulmonary hypertension exhibits a uniform cellular pathophysiology in the pulmonary microcirculation.    The dysfunction of lung vascular endothelial cells, which are the front line in response to hemodynamic changes in the pulmonary circulation, is the pathophysiological driving force of pulmonary hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a reduced production of vasodilative, anti-proliferative mediators and an increased release of vasoconstrictive, proliferative factors. This apparent imbalance not only enhances pulmonary vasoconstriction, but supports pathologic remodeling processes in the vascular intima and media. In addition, the pulmonary endothelium recruits platelets and leukocytes, thus, contributing to further release of vasoconstrictive and proliferative mediators and characteristic thrombus formation. These endothelium-derived pathomechanisms amplify each other, further enhance pulmonary vascular resistance, and finally result in fixation of the hypertensive state.    Hence, pulmonary hypertension not only describes an alteration of lung hemodynamics, but comprises a complex set of pathophysiological events in both lung parenchymal cells and circulating blood cells.

959,11744011,"['The', 'inflammatory', 'response', 'myocardial', 'infarction']","One of the major therapeutic goals of modern cardiology is to design strategies aimed at minimizing myocardial necrosis and optimizing cardiac repair following myocardial infarction. However, a sound understanding of the biology is necessary before a specific intervention is pursued on a therapeutic basis. This review summarizes our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Myocardial necrosis induces complement activation and free radical generation, triggering a cytokine cascade initiated by Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha release. If reperfusion of the infarcted area is initiated, it is attended by an intense inflammatory reaction. Interleukin (IL)-8 synthesis and C5a activation have a crucial role in recruiting neutrophils in the ischemic and reperfused myocardium. Neutrophil infiltration is regulated through a complex sequence of molecular steps involving the selectins and the integrins, which mediate leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the endothelium. Marginated neutrophils exert potent cytotoxic effects through the release of proteolytic enzymes and the adhesion with Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 expressing cardiomyocytes. Despite this potential injury, substantial evidence suggests that reperfusion enhances cardiac repair improving patient survival; this effect may be in part related to the inflammatory response. Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP)-1 is also markedly upregulated in the infarcted myocardium inducing recruitment of mononuclear cells in the injured areas. Monocyte-derived macrophages and mast cells may produce cytokines and growth factors necessary for fibroblast proliferation and neovascularization, leading to effective repair and scar formation. At this stage expression of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 may have a role in suppressing the acute inflammatory response and in regulating extracellular matrix metabolism. Fibroblasts in the healing scar undergo phenotypic changes expressing smooth muscle cell markers. Our previous review in this journal focused almost exclusively on reduction of the inflammatory injury. The current update is prompted by the potential therapeutic opportunity that the open vessel offers. By promoting more effective tissue repair, it may be possible to reduce the deleterious remodeling, that is the leading cause of heart failure and death. Elucidating the complex interactions and regulatory mechanisms responsible for cardiac repair may allow us to design effective inflammation-related interventions for the treatment of myocardial infarction.",2002,Nonprogrammatic,"['Section of Cardiovascular Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine and the DeBakey Heart Center, One Baylor Plaza M/S F-602, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Cardiovascular research'],"['United States', 'England']","[['Frangogiannis', 'Nikolaos G'], ['Smith', 'C Wayne'], ['Entman', 'Mark L']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",['Nonprogrammatic'],2000s,90-2010s

Analysis of transgenic mdx mice that were null mutants for dystrophin, but expressed normal levels of NO in muscle, showed that the normalization of NO production caused large reductions in macrophage concentrations in the mdx muscle. Expression of the NOS transgene in mdx muscle also prevented the majority of muscle membrane injury that is detectable in vivo, and resulted in large decreases in serum creatine kinase concentrations. Furthermore, our data show that mdx muscle macrophages are cytolytic at concentrations that occur in dystrophic, NOS-deficient muscle, but are not cytolytic at concentrations that occur in dystrophic mice that express the NOS transgene in muscle. Finally, our data show that antibody depletions of macrophages from mdx mice cause significant reductions in muscle membrane injury.

In this patient group (n=138) the presence of PFR was correlated against the amount of pericardial effusion measured echocardiographically.RESULTS: No statistically significant correlation between the presence of PFR and the amount of pericardial effusion was observed. It is, therefore, a misconception that the presence of a PFR signifies absence or only a small volume of pericardial effusion.

Instead fibrin strands caused by the inflammation, connecting the two pericardial layers, may function as snares and generate, through the movements of the heart, the typical triphasic pericardial friction rub.",2001,pericardial effusion pericardial friction rub,[],['eng'],['Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation'],['Netherlands'],"[['Natan', 'S'], ['Lamfers', 'E J P'], ['Ophuis', 'A J M Oude'], ['Meursing', 'B T J']]",['Journal Article'],"['pericardial', 'effusion', 'pericardial', 'friction', 'rub']",2000s,90-2010s

Results were compared between the patients with symptomatic, asymptomatic CMV, and no CMV. All four patients with CMV disease had fever during the aplastic phase after bone marrow transplantation and all of them showed a marked increase of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and interleukin-8 at the time of leukocyte recovery (p<0.05; two-way layout analysis of variance). Patients without CMV disease despite of reactivation of the virus, showed a significant increase of interferon-γ p<0.05; two-way layout analysis of variance), but there was no rise of tumor necrosis factor-a or interleukin-8. Cytomegalovirus-negative patients showed no increase of any of these cytokines. Elevation of these three cytokines may cause CMV replication, and inflammation during the aplastic phase may promote such a cytokine increase. Our findings suggest that a marked increase of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-8 during engraftment after bone marrow transplantation may be related to CMV disease.

RA is treated with an interdisciplinary approach, in which disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are an important component. The recommended first choice is one or more DMARDs. In the absence of treatment effect, a biologic drug may be added. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of biologics, compared with DMARDs in patients with early (≤ 3 years) RA.

We included a total of 12 randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of biologics infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept and abatacept. The results suggest that, compared with DMARDs alone, biologicals in combination with DMARDs give:more patients in remission; neither more or less serious adverse events; more patients who achieved a 50% improvement; improved physical function; less joint destruction.

Although strong efforts have been made to regenerate degenerated joint cartilage, OA is a progressive and irreversible disease up to date. Among other factors the dysbalance between free radical burden and cellular scavenging mechanisms defined as oxidative stress is a relevant part of OA pathogenesis. Here, only little data are available about the mediation and interaction between different joint compartments. The article provides a review of the current literature regarding the influence of oxidative stress on cellular aging, senescence and apoptosis in different joint compartments (cartilage, synovial tissue and subchondral bone). Free radical exposure is known to promote cellular senescence and apoptosis. Radical oxygen species (ROS) involvement in inflammation, fibrosis control and pain nociception has been proven. The data from literature indicates a link between free radical burden and OA pathogenesis mediating local tissue reactions between the joint compartments. Hence, oxidative stress is likely not only to promote cartilage destruction but also to be involved in inflammative transformation, promoting the transition from clinically silent cartilage destruction to apparent OA. ROS induced by exogenous factors such as overload, trauma, local intraarticular lesion and consecutive synovial inflammation cause cartilage degradation. In the affected joint, free radicals mediate disease progression.

The different regional and cellular distributions of the various PMCA isoforms and splice variants in the nervous system and the diverse phenotypes of PMCA knockout mice support the notion that each isoform might play a distinct role. Especially in the spinal cord, the survival of neurons and, in particular, motor neurons could be dependent on PMCA2. This is indicated by the knockdown of PMCA2 in pure spinal cord neuronal cultures that leads to cell death via a decrease in collapsing response mediator protein 1 levels. Moreover, the progressive decline in the number of motor neurons in PMCA2-null mice and heterozygous mice further supports this notion. Therefore, the reported reduction in PMCA2 mRNA and protein levels in the inflamed spinal cord of mice affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and after spinal cord contusion injury, suggests that changes in PMCA2 expression could be a cause of neuronal pathology and death during inflammation and injury. Glutamate excitotoxicity mediated via kainate receptors has been implicated in the neuropathology of both EAE and spinal cord injury, and has been identified as a trigger that reduces PMCA2 levels in pure spinal cord neuronal cultures through degradation of the pump by calpain without affecting PMCA2 transcript levels.

Over-production of ROS and/or decrease in the antioxidant capacity cause cells to undergo oxidative stress that damages cellular macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. Oxidative stress is associated with ageing and the development of age-related diseases such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. ROS activate signaling pathways that promote cell survival or lead to cell death, depending on the source and site of ROS production, the specific ROS generated, the concentration and kinetics of ROS generation, and the cell types being challenged. However, how the nature and compartmentalization of ROS contribute to the pathogenesis of individual diseases is poorly understood. Consequently, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular bases of cell oxidative stress signaling, which will then provide novel therapeutic opportunities to interfere with disease progression via targeting specific signaling pathways.

Low concentrations (1-100 μM) of ATP transiently increased the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in cells from both mice. The inhibition of the polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C with U73122 inhibited this response especially in WT mice suggesting that the responses coupled to P2Y receptors were potentiated by the expression of P2X(7) receptors. One millimolar ATP provoked a sustained increase in the [Ca(2+)](i) only in WT mice. The response to 10 μM ATP was potentiated and prolonged by ivermectin in both mice. One millimolar ATP increased the influx of extracellular calcium, decreased the intracellular concentration of potassium ([K(+)](i)) and stimulated the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) only in cells from WT mice. Ten micromolar ATP in combination with 3 μM ivermectin reproduced these responses both in WT and KO mice. The secretion of IL-1β was also increased by nigericin in WT mice and the secretory effect of a combination of ivermectin with ATP in KO mice was suppressed in a medium containing a high concentration of potassium. In WT mice, 150 μM BzATP stimulated the uptake of YOPRO-1. Incubation of macrophages from WT and KO mice with 10 μM ATP resulted in a small increase of YOPRO-1 uptake, which was potentiated by addition of 3 μM ivermectin. The uptake of this dye was unaffected by pannexin-1 blockers. In conclusion, prolonged stimulation of P2X(4) receptors by a combination of low concentrations of ATP plus ivermectin produced a sustained activation of the non-selective cation channel coupled to this receptor.

The majority of clear cell RCCs, the major histological subtype, have genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Germline mutations in the MET and fumarate hydratase (FH) genes lead to the development of type 1 and type 2 papillary RCCs, respectively, and such mutations of either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene increase the risk of RCC. Genome-wide copy number alteration analysis has suggested that loss of chromosome 3p and gain of chromosomes 5q and 7 may be copy number aberrations indispensable for the development of clear cell RCC. When chromosome 1p, 4, 9, 13q or 14q is also lost, more clinicopathologically aggressive clear cell RCC may develop. Since renal carcinogenesis is associated with neither chronic inflammation nor persistent viral infection, and hardly any histological change is evident in corresponding non-tumorous renal tissue from patients with renal tumors, precancerous conditions in the kidney have been rarely described. However, regional DNA hypermethylation on C-type CpG islands has already accumulated in such non-cancerous renal tissues, suggesting that, from the viewpoint of altered DNA methylation, the presence of precancerous conditions can be recognized even in the kidney. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in precancerous conditions are basically inherited by the corresponding clear cell RCCs developing in individual patients: DNA methylation alterations at the precancerous stage may further predispose renal tissue to epigenetic and genetic alterations, generate more malignant cancers, and even determine patient outcome. The list of tumor-related genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation has recently been increasing. Genetic and epigenetic profiling provides an optimal means of prognostication for patients with RCCs.

Activation of autonomous nervous system; sudden pressure increase in vital organs such as lungs and liver; and activation of neuroendocrine-immune system are among the most important mechanisms that contribute significantly to molecular changes and cascading injury mechanisms in the brain. It has been hypothesized that vagally mediated cerebral effects play a vital role in the early response to blast: this assumption has been supported by experiments where bilateral vagotomy mitigated bradycardia, hypotension, and apnea, and also prevented excessive metabolic alterations in the brain of animals exposed to blast. Clinical experience suggests specific blast-body-nervous system interactions such as (1) direct interaction with the head either through direct passage of the blast wave through the skull or by causing acceleration and/or rotation of the head; and (2) via hydraulic interaction, when the blast overpressure compresses the abdomen and chest, and transfers its kinetic energy to the body's fluid phase, initiating oscillating waves that traverse the body and reach the brain.

Supplementation with anthocyanin-rich extracts from black rice or purple sweet potato was reported to attenuate atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apo E(-/-)) mice. However, the mechanism(s) of their preventive action are not completely understood. Previous studies revealed that anthocyanins altered mRNA levels of genes related to atherosclerosis in cultured macrophages and endothelial cells, but in vivo studies remain scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of bilberry anthocyanin-rich extract (BE) supplementation on gene expression in the liver of apo E(-/-) mice, the widely used model of atherosclerosis. The liver was chosen because it is the main site of lipid metabolism. Apo E(-/-) mice received for 2 weeks a standard diet supplemented with a nutritional dose of BE (0.02%). This study focused on the early stage of atherosclerosis development for better assessment of anthocyanin action on initiation mechanisms of this pathology. The results showed that a 2-week supplementation significantly reduced plasmatic total cholesterol and hepatic triglyceride levels, whereas the plasmatic antioxidant status remained unchanged. Transcriptional analysis, using microarrays, revealed that the expression of 2,289 genes was significantly altered. BE over-expressed genes involved in bile acid synthesis and cholesterol uptake into the liver and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These results suggest an anti-atherogenic effect of BE through the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and liver inflammation and provide a global integrated view of the mechanisms involved in the preventive action of this extract.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12263-010-0171-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",2010,Anthocyanins Apo Edeficient mice Atherosclerosis Liver Microarray,[],['eng'],['Genes & nutrition'],['Germany'],"[['Mauray', 'Aurelie'], ['Felgines', 'Catherine'], ['Morand', 'Christine'], ['Mazur', 'Andrzej'], ['Scalbert', 'Augustin'], ['Milenkovic', 'Dragan']]",['Journal Article'],"['Anthocyanins', 'Apo', 'Edeficient', 'mice', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Liver', 'Microarray']",2000s,90-2010s

The primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare disorder affecting both medium- and small-sized vessels. Major symptoms of cerebral vasculitis are stroke, headache and encephalopathy. Diagnosis is based on laboratory and imaging findings. When cerebral affection occurs in systemic vasculitis an acute inflammatory response with raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased values of C-reactive protein is present. In many cerebral vasculitides including PACNS, CSF studies reveal inflammatory findings. Magnetic resonance imaging, including ADC maps, diffusion and gradient echo sequences, is the investigation of choice to detect and monitor cerebral involvement. Certain MRI techniques and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography allow the visualization of vessel wall inflammation when the lumen is still unaffected on angiography. The treatment recommendations for cerebral angitis are derived from protocols for systemic vasculitides. In general, a combination of steroids and pulse cyclophosphamide (CYC) is recommended for induction treatment. An alternative option is the use of the anti- CD20 antibody rituximab.

The purpose of this personal view is to revise the case for NSAIDs in AD therapeutics in light of: (i) the last report from the only primary prevention trial in AD, ADAPT, which, although incomplete, points to significant protection in long-term naproxen users, and (ii) the recently proposed dynamic model of AD evolution. The model contends that there is a clinical silent phase in AD that can last up to 20 years, the duration depending on life style habits, genetic factors, or cognitive reserve. The failure of many purported disease-modifying drugs in AD clinical trials is forcing the view that treatments will only be efficacious if administered pre-clinically. Here we will argue that NSAIDs failed in clinical trials because they are disease-modifying drugs, and they should be administered in early stages of the disease. A complete prevention trial in cognitively normal individuals is thus called for. Further, the shift of anti-inflammatory treatment to early stages uncovers a knowledge void about the targets of NSAIDs in asymptomatic individuals. AD researchers have mostly relied on post-mortem analysis of Aβ plaque-laden brains from demented patients or animal models, thus drawing conclusions about AD pathogenesis based on late symptoms. We will discuss evidence in support that defective, not excessive, inflammation underlies AD pathogenesis, that NSAIDs are multifunctional drugs acting on inflammatory and non-inflammatory targets, and that astrocytes and microglia may play differing roles in disease progression, with an emphasis of ApoEε4 as a key, undervalued target of NSAIDs.

Several risk factors influence its progress, and are categorized as classic, traditional and novel factors. The role of unknown risk factors is becoming increasingly more significant recently. The aim of this study is to underscore the novel risk factors despite the importance of classic factors and consider these factors for future studies.METHODS: This is a prospective study on 180 myocardial infarction cases, conducted in the cardiology ward and CCU of Imam-Reza hospital (Mashad-IRAN). A number of risk factors identified and evaluated in these patients included: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, activity, stress, hair of external ear canal and ear lobe crease, age, and sex. Then patients without any risk factor or with one or two risk factors were distinguished.RESULTS: The majority of our patients were old men in the age range of 60 - 69 years. Amongst all patients 42.2% were smokers, 68.3% were type A personality group, 19% were active, 81% were physically inactive, 37.2% had hairy ear canal, 35% had hypertension, 21.1% were diabetic, 14.4% had hyperlipidemia and 30% had positive family history of myocardial infarction. Of great interest was the fact that of the patients whose case was studied, many did not have any risk factor or in some cases had only one.CONCLUSIONS: In regard of increasing rate of cardiovascular diseases and myocardial infarction even amongst the young population, and because of considerable need to improve vascular risk detection, much research over the past decade has focused on identification of novel atherosclerotic risk factors, and some of these new risk factors are identified and some may be unknown. Amongst the new risk factors, inflammation has an important role, other risk factors that must be assessed are homocysteine, serum amyloid, and antibodies against Oxidized LDL.

Accumulation of large amounts of oxidized LDL in the intima during local inflammation reaction led to increase several factors such as C -reactive protein (CRP). It has also been reported that CRP is able to bind with modified forms of LDL as well as oxidized LDL. These findings suggest possible positive or negative involvement of this protein in atherogenesis. The main objective of the present study was to assess the influence of CRP on LDL oxidation and the possible physical \changes of LDL in the presence of CRP in vitro.METHODS: In this study, the susceptibility of purified LDL to oxidation was assayed by monitoring of formation of conjugated dienes in different physiological concentrations of CRP (0 - 0.5 -2 µg/ml) using a shimadzu spectrophotometer. Electrophoresis was used to determine the electrophoretic mobility of LDL in those conditions.RESULTS: CRP significantly reduced the susceptibility of Cu(++) -induced LDL oxidation through increasing the lag timeand there was positive relationship between these findings and CRP concentration (P < 0.05). CRP caused a significant reduction in the electrophotretic mobility of LDL compared to native LDL (n-LDL) (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: A considerable reduction was shown in LDL oxidation, in higher concentration of CRP, via an unknown mechanism. The electrophoretic mobility of LDL, in the oxidative condition, decreases in the presence of CRP compared to n-LDL, which can be indicative of the effect of this protein on the physical and chemical properties of LDL.

The control of this inflammation remains a key strategy for treating the disease; however, there are no current anti-inflammatory treatments that are effective. Although glucocorticoids (GCs) effectively control inflammation in many diseases such as asthma, they are less effective in COPD. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of this relative GC-insensitive inflammation in the lung of patients with COPD remain unclear. However, recent studies have indicated novel mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies. One of the major mechanisms proposed is an oxidant-mediated alteration in the signaling pathways in the inflammatory cells in the lung, which may result in the impairment of repressor proteins used by the GC receptor to inhibit the transcription of proinflammatory genes. Although these studies have described mechanisms and targets by which GC function can be restored in cells from patients with COPD, more work is needed to completely elucidate these and other pathways that may be involved in order to allow for more confident therapeutic targeting. Given the relative GC-insensitive nature of the inflammation in COPD, a combination of therapies in addition to a restoration of GC function, including effective alternative anti-inflammatory targets, antioxidants, and proresolving therapeutic strategies, is likely to provide better targeting and improvement in the management of the disease.",2010,histone deacetylase inflammation oxidative stress p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase phosphoinositol 3kinase,"[""Medical Research Council Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, UK. john.marwick@ed.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'],"['United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom', 'New Zealand']","[['Marwick', 'John A'], ['Chung', 'Kian Fan']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']","['histone', 'deacetylase', 'inflammation', 'oxidative', 'stress', 'p', 'mitogenactivated', 'protein', 'kinase', 'phosphoinositol', 'kinase']",2000s,90-2010s

However, few investigations have focused on the dose-response effects of bleomycin on pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of different doses of bleomycin in male mice. ICR mice were given 3 consecutive doses of bleomycin: 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg in bleomycin-treated (BT) groups and saline only in vehicle control (VC) groups. The animals were sacrificed at 7 and 24 days postinstillation. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated according to inflammatory cell count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) , and lung tissues were histologically evaluated after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) , and Masson's trichrome staining. BT groups exhibited changed cellular profiles in BAL fluid compared to the VC group, which had an increased number of total cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and a modest increase in the number of macrophages at 7 days post-bleomycin instillation. Moreover, BT groups showed a dose-dependent increase in LDH levels and inflammatory cell counts. However, at 24 days after treatment, collagen deposition, interstitial thickening, and granulomatous lesions were observed in the alveolar spaces in addition to a decrease in inflammatory cells. These results indicate that pulmonary fibrosis induced by 4 mg/kg bleomycin was more severe than that induced by 1 or 2 mg/kg.

The findings from a recent meta-analysis revealed that supplemental vitamin D at a dose of at least 700-1,000 IU/d or an achieved serum 25(OH)D level of at least 60 nmol/L was associated with reduced falls risk among older individuals. Based on these findings, it is possible that the combination of exercise and vitamin D could have a synergistic effect on muscle morphology and function, particularly since both interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects on type II ""fast twitch"" muscle fibers and systemic inflammation, which have both been linked to losses in muscle mass and function. Unfortunately however, the findings from the limited number of factorial 2 × 2 design RCTs indicate that additional vitamin D does not enhance the effects of exercise on measures of muscle morphology, function or falls risk. However, none of these trials were adequately powered to detect a ""synergistic"" effect between the two treatment strategies, but it is likely that if an exercise-by-vitamin D interaction does exist, it may be limited to situations when vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is corrected. Further targeted research in ""high risk"" groups is still needed to address this question, and evaluate whether there is a threshold level of serum 25(OH)D to maximize the effects of exercise on muscle and falls risk.",2010,falls interaction older adults resistance training sarcopenia vitamin D,"['Department of Medicine (RMH/WH), The University of Melbourne, Western Hospital, Melbourne 3011, Australia. rdaly@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],['Nutrients'],['Switzerland'],"[['Daly', 'Robin M']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']","['falls', 'interaction', 'older', 'adults', 'resistance', 'training', 'sarcopenia', 'vitamin', 'D']",2000s,90-2010s

Seventeen smoking and 22 non-smoking patients not using inhaled corticosteroids with slightly uncontrolled mild asthma completed the study.RESULTS: ACQ and AQLQ scores were similar in both groups at baseline and improved similarly after treatments. beta2-agonist use was higher in smokers, regardless of the treatment received (p=0.03), as it was on baseline (p=0.003).

Yet, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is associated with whole blood viscosity and it is an indirect acute phase inflammation marker.AIMS: This work investigates the prevalence of hyperviscosity in acute phase inflammation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archived clinical pathology data for the period of 1999 to 2008 were utilized. 40,632-cases tested for C-reactive protein and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate from five alternate years, which were concomitantly tested for haematocrit and total proteins, were extracted. The prevalence of abnormal viscosity associated with positive results of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were evaluated.RESULTS: Hyperviscosity is infrequently associated with positive C-reactive protein (2.9%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (2.7%) sub-populations, and are not statistically different from their respective negative sub-populations. Normoviscosity is significantly more prevalent in the positive sub-populations (p < 0.01). Further analyses indicate that prevalence of acute phase inflammation is statistically significantly less in hyperviscosity compared to normoviscosity sub-population (p < 0.00001). Actual blood viscosity level increases with level of inflammation though.CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that although blood viscosity level may increase with inflammation, hyperviscosity is not frequent in, or sensitive to acute phase inflammation. It portends that whole blood viscosity is not unspecific as acute phase inflammation markers. It calls for clinicians to consider utilizing whole blood viscosity in disease conditions where stasis is implicated, in which it is specific and valuable.

In line, aging-related reduction in Reelin expression has been shown to contribute to cognitive impairments during normal aging. Although recent experimental evidence suggests an involvement of dysfunctional Reelin in pathological forms of aging, such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), the molecular mechanisms by which this conserved extracellular glycoprotein contributes to the pathogenesis of AD remains still largely unknown. In the present review, we briefly summarize the role of Reelin in the developing and adult brain and discuss the implication of loss- or gain-of-functions of developmental programs in the adult brain as putative inducing factors of pathological forms of aging. Finally, we will propose some new concepts on the role of inflammatory cytokines in interfering with Reelin-mediated signaling during neurodevelopment and adult synaptic function, and discuss how this could be translated into a novel non-transgenic mouse model of late-onset AD.

The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between hepatic steatosis and inflammation with FASN expression. In vitro incubation of primary human hepatocytes with fatty acids dose-dependently induced cellular lipid-accumulation and FASN expression, while stimulation with TNF did not affect FASN levels. Further, hepatic FASN expression was significantly increased in vivo in a murine model of hepatic steatosis without significant inflammation but not in a murine NASH model as compared to control mice. Also, FASN expression was not increased in mice subjected to bile duct ligation, an experimental model characterized by severe hepatocellular damage and inflammation. Furthermore, FASN expression was analyzed in 102 human control or NAFLD livers applying tissue micro array technology and immunohistochemistry, and correlated significantly with the degree of hepatic steatosis, but not with inflammation or ballooning of hepatocytes. Quantification of FASN mRNA expression in human liver samples confirmed significantly higher FASN levels in hepatic steatosis but not in NASH, and expression of SREBP1, which is the main transcriptional regulator of FASN, paralleled FASN expression levels in human and experimental NAFLD. In conclusion, the transcriptional induction of FASN expression in hepatic steatosis is impaired in NASH, while hepatic inflammation in the absence of steatosis does not affect FASN expression, suggesting that FASN may serve as a new diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for the progression of NAFLD.",2010,Fatty acid synthase FASN Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD SREBP1 expression immunohistochemistry nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Regensburg, D-93042 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['International journal of clinical and experimental pathology'],['United States'],"[['Dorn', 'Christoph'], ['Riener', 'Marc-Oliver'], ['Kirovski', 'Georgi'], ['Saugspier', 'Michael'], ['Steib', 'Kathrin'], ['Weiss', 'Thomas S'], ['Gäbele', 'Erwin'], ['Kristiansen', 'Glen'], ['Hartmann', 'Arndt'], ['Hellerbrand', 'Claus']]",['Journal Article'],"['Fatty', 'acid', 'synthase', 'FASN', 'Nonalcoholic', 'fatty', 'liver', 'disease', 'NAFLD', 'SREBP', 'expression', 'immunohistochemistry', 'nonalcoholic', 'steatohepatitis', 'NASH']",2000s,90-2010s

Now, in Part 2, we focus on the medical therapies and treatment strategies (early conservative vs early invasive) used for UA/NSTEMI. We also discuss results from various large randomized controlled trials that have led to the contemporary standards of practice for, and reduced morbidity and death from, UA/NSTEMI. In summary, ACS involving UA/NSTEMI is associated with high rates of adverse cardiovascular events, despite recent therapeutic advances. Plaque composition and inflammation are more important in the pathogenesis of ACS than is the actual degree of arterial stenosis. As results from new trials challenge our current practices and help us develop the optimal treatment strategy for UA/NSTEMI patients, the cornerstones of contemporary treatment remain early risk stratification and aggressive medical therapy, supplemented by coronary angiography in appropriately selected patients. An early-invasive-treatment strategy is of most benefit to high-risk patients, whereas an early-conservative strategy is recommended for low-risk patients. Adjunctive medical therapy with acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel or another adenosine diphosphate antagonist, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and either low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, in the appropriate setting, further reduces the risk of ischemic events secondary to thrombosis.

Periostin is a matricellular protein normally expressed in adult skin, but its role in skin organogenesis, incisional wound healing and skin pathology has yet to be investigated in any depth. Using C57/BL6 mouse skin as model, we first investigated periostin protein and mRNA spatiotemporal expression and distribution during development and after incisional wounding. Secondarily we assessed whether periostin is expressed in human skin pathologies, including keloid and hypertrophic scars, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. During development, periostin is expressed in the dermis, basement membrane and hair follicles from embryonic through neonatal stages and in the dermis and hair follicle only in adult. In situ hybridization demonstrated that dermal fibroblasts and basal keratinocytes express periostin mRNA. After incisional wounding, periostin becomes re-expressed in the basement membrane within the dermal-epidermal junction at the wound edge re-establishing the embryonic deposition pattern present in the adult. Analysis of periostin expression in human pathologies demonstrated that it is over-expressed in keloid and hypertrophic scars, atopic dermatitis, but is largely absent from sites of inflammation and inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis. Furthermore, in vitro we demonstrated that periostin is a transforming growth factor beta 1 inducible gene in human dermal fibroblasts. We conclude that periostin is an important ECM component during development, in wound healing and is strongly associated with pathological skin remodeling.SUMMARY: Periostin is a fibrogenic protein that mediates fibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix synthesis.

The incidence of residual gallstones following cholecystectomy is <2.5%. Many of these patients require a completion cholecystectomy to ameliorate their symptoms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed our experience of laparoscopic re-intervention for residual gallstones over a period of 10 years from January 1998 to December 2007. Twenty six patients underwent Laparoscopic completion cholecystectomy (LCC) for residual gallstone disease. Twelve patients had a previous LC (2 patients - subtotal cholecystectomy) and 9 patients had a previous open cholecystectomy (7 patients - subtotal cholecystectomy). Five patients had previously undergone a cholecystostomy. Diagnostic investigations included abdominal ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).RESULTS: Findings included a remnant gallbladder in 3 patients, long cystic duct stump with impacted stone in 18 patients and a contracted gallbladder in 5 patients. All procedures were successfully completed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 62 minutes and mean blood loss 50cc. Ten patient required abdominal drains postoperatively.

A professional plaque control programme was undertaken to establish healthy gingival conditions at baseline. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) were recorded at 60 sites at baseline, after 21 days of no oral hygiene and one week later after professional cleaning and reestablishment of oral hygiene procedures. A total of 180 samples were analyzed with ELISA for levels of IL -6, IL-8 and TNF-a in gingival crevicular fluid. The examination included the mesiobuccal sites of the Ramfjord teeth.

Although it is more invasive than shock wave lithotripsy and retrograde ureteroscopic surgery, percutaneous nephroscopic surgery has been successfully performed with high efficiency and low morbidity in difficult renal anatomies and patient conditions. These advantages of minimal invasiveness were rapidly perceived and applied to the management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, calyceal diverticulum, infundibular stenosis, and urothelial cancer. The basic principle of endopyelotomy is a full-thickness incision of the narrow segment followed by prolonged stenting and drainage to allow regeneration of an adequate caliber ureter. The preferred technique for a calyceal diverticulum continues to be debated. Excellent long-term success has been reported with percutaneous, ureteroscopic, and laparoscopic techniques. Each approach is based on the location and size of the diverticulum. So far, percutaneous ablation of the calyceal diverticulum is the most established minimally invasive technique. Infundibular stenosis is an acquired condition usually associated with inflammation or stones. Reported series of percutaneously treated infundibular stenosis are few.

Also, serum leptin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the OBC group than in the NC group. In contrast, the OB-SBE group showed a reversal in the metabolic defects, including a decrease in glucose, insulin, IAUC, HOMA-IR, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and leptin levels.

Affected patients frequently have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis due to persistent upper and lower airway inflammation with marked eosinophilia. IL-13 plays a crucial role in the development of allergic asthma by inducing airway eosinophilia and hyper-reactivity and it has been correlated with an increased eosinophil count.METHODS: Two promoter polymorphisms of the IL-13 gene (-1510 A>C and -1055C>T) and one coding nonsynonymus Arg110Gln (110G>A) polymorphism were genotyped using primer extension methods in 162 patients with AIA, 301 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), and 430 normal healthy controls (NC).RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of the three polymorphisms among the three groups. AIA patients with the AA genotype -1510A>C (P=0.012) and CC genotype -1055C>T (P<0.001) had a significantly higher frequency of rhinosinusitis, as compared to those with the minor alleles of these two single nucleotide polymorphisms.

The activation of PPARgamma regulates inflammation by downregulating the production of Th2 type cytokines and eosinophil function. In addition, a range of natural substances, including arachidonate pathway metabolites such as 15-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (15-HETE), strongly promote PPARG expression. Therefore, genetic variants of the PPARG gene may be associated with the development of aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). We investigated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the PPARG gene and AIA.METHODS: Based on the results of an oral aspirin challenge, asthmatics (n=403) were categorized into two groups: those with a decrease in FEV(1) of 15% or greater (AIA) or less than 15% (aspirin-tolerant asthma, ATA). We genotyped two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PPARG gene from Korean asthmatics and normal controls (n=449): +34C>G (Pro12Ala) and +82466C>T (His449His).RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that +82466C>T and haplotype 1 (CC) were associated with the development of aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics (P=0.04).

They can be a source of persistent pain and dysfunction in the active overhead throwing athlete. It is important to distinguish between scapulothoracic bursitis and scapulothoracic crepitus. Scapulothoracic bursitis refers to inflammation of the bursae secondary to trauma or overuse owing to sports activities or work. Scapulothoracic crepitus is defined by a grinding, popping, or thumping sound or sensation secondary to abnormal scapulothoracic motion.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This article presents the causes, diagnosis, and management of these shoulder conditions in a manner that is relevant to clinicians, athletic trainers, and physical therapists, and it reviews relevant studies to determine the consensus on nonoperative treatment, as well as open and arthroscopic surgical treatment.RESULTS: The causes of scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus include direct or indirect trauma, overuse syndromes, glenohumeral joint dysfunction, osseous abnormalities, muscle atrophy or fibrosis, and idiopathic causes. Scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus remain primarily clinical diagnoses; however, imaging studies or local injections may also be helpful. The initial treatment of scapulothoracic bursitis and scapulothoracic crepitus should be nonoperative. Surgical treatment options include partial scapulectomy or resection of the superomedial angle of the scapula, open bursal resection, and arthroscopic bursectomy. Despite the lack of agreement among orthopaedic surgeons concerning which procedure is best for treating symptomatic scapulothoracic bursitis and crepitus, most reports have demonstrated good to excellent outcomes in a significantly high percentage of patients.CONCLUSION: Clearly, the best initial approach to these conditions is a nonoperative treatment plan that combines scapular strengthening, postural reeducation, and core strength endurance. The addition of local modalities, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, and localized injections may also be helpful.

It is difficult to diagnose cysticercosis on ultrasonography. Ultrasonography was done on Logiq 500 Pro machine with convex probe at 3.5 MHz frequency and diagnosed as cysticercosis with surrounding inflammation in the right vastus medialis muscle of thigh with a linear probe at 9.6 MHz frequency. In this case, we are discussing the role of high resolution sonography which helped in non-invasive diagnosis and treatment.CASE REPORT: A 12 years old male patient presented with a swelling on the medial aspect of the right thigh. There was complaint of pain in the right thigh for the last one week with history of fever since three days. On local examination, a single swelling of size approximately 4x5 cm in the right medial aspect of thigh was present. On ultrasonography there was a well defined isolated cystic lesion of size 3.3 × 2.5 cm intermuscular area. We have successfully managed the patient conservatively with albendazole and steroids only.CONCLUSION: We conclude that intermuscular cystic swelling in thigh can be diagnosed on high resolution sonography with a great confidence to manage it conservatively.

Both Arg- and Lys-gingipain preparations induced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-8 by macrophages. Stimulation of macrophages with Arg-gingipain A/B preparation at the highest concentration was associated with lower amounts of cytokines detected, a phenomenon likely related to proteolytic degradation. The inflammatory response induced by gingipains was not dependent of their catalytic activity since heat-inactivated preparations were still effective. Stimulating macrophages with gingipain preparations was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated p38α MAPK suggesting its involvement in cell activation.

A number of studies have evaluated the functional polymorphism -28C/G in the RANTES promoter region, which had been found to affect the transcription of the RANTES gene, in relation to asthma susceptibility. However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. This meta-analysis on 1894 asthma cases and 1766 controls for -28C/G from 9 published case-control studies showed that the variant allele -28G was associated with significantly increased risk of asthma (GG+CG vs CC: OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.08-1.41) without any between-study heterogeneity.In the stratified analysis by asthma type, age and ethnicity, we found that the increased asthma risk associated with -28G/C polymorphism was more evident in children (OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.06-1.45), Asian group (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.04-1.56) and African group (OR=1.72, 95%CI=1.07-2.78).

Acute MS exacerbations are believed be the result of active inflammation, and progression of disability is generally believed to reflect accumulation of damage to the CNS, particularly axonal damage. Over the last several years, the pathophysiology of MS is being appreciated to be much more complex, and it appears that the development of the MS plaque involves a large number of cell populations, including CD8+ T lymphocytes, B cells, and Th17 cells (a population of helper T cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokine IL-17). The axonal transection and degeneration that is thought to represent the basis for progressive MS is now recognized to begin early in the disease process and to continue in the progressive forms of the disease. Molecules important for limiting aberrant neural connections in the CNS have been identified, which suppress axonal sprouting and regeneration of transected axons within the CNS. Pathways have also been identified that prevent remyelination of the MS lesion by oligodendrocyte precursors. Novel neuroimaging methodologies and potential biomarkers are being developed to monitor various aspects of the disease process in MS.

Ovariectomized (Ovx) and sham operated wild-type (WT) and Fat-1 mice were fed an AIN-93M diet containing 10% corn oil for 24 weeks. BMD was analysed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fat-1 Ovx mice exhibited significantly lower level of osteotropic factors like receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)5b in serum and higher BMD in distal femoral metaphysis, proximal tibial metaphysis, femoral diaphysis and lumbar vertebra as compared to WT Ovx mice. LPS-stimulated bone marrow (BM) cells from Fat-1 Ovx mice produced significantly lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6 and higher level of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, IFN-gamma and higher level of nitric oxide as compared to BM cells from WT Ovx mice.

The molecular mechanisms of cordycepin in T2D are not clear. In the present study, we tested the role of cordycepin on the anti-diabetic effect and anti-inflammatory cascades in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.METHODS: We confirmed the levels of diabetes regulating genes mRNA and protein of cytokines through RT-PCR and western blot analysis and followed by FACS analysis for the surface molecules.RESULTS: Cordycepin inhibited the production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in LPS-activated macrophages via suppressing protein expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. T2D regulating genes such as 11beta-HSD1 and PPARgamma were decreased as well as expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as ICAM-1 and B7-1/-2 were also decreased with the increment of its concentration. In accordance with suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production lead to inhibition of diabetic regulating genes in activated macrophages.

Possible mechanisms include metabolic disturbances, myocardial fibrosis, chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Recognizing early stages of DDF may help to identify patients at risk of developing symptomatic DDF. Therefore, biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological changes within the myocardium were investigated in patients with DDF.METHODS: Seventy-seven patients submitted for coronary angiography with stable or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) were consecutively enrolled. Those without known diabetes mellitus (DM) underwent a standardized oral glucose tolerance test. Echocardiography for the diagnosis of DDF was performed according to the European Society of Cardiology. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) serum concentrations were analyzed using the ELISA technique.RESULTS: A total of 36% of patients had DM and 74% had CAD. The prevalence of DDF was higher in patients with DM (89% versus 74%) and CAD (84% versus 53%) (P<0.05). DDF in patients with DM was more severe with a significantly lower mitral annulus velocity of 6.5 cm/s versus 7.8 cm/s (P<0.01).

Samples were extracted in methanol, dried, diluted in saline, and then analyzed for chemical constituents. Female CD-1 mice received either 25 or 100 microg of each size fraction via oropharyngeal aspiration. At 4 and 18 hr postexposure, mice were assessed for pulmonary responsiveness to inhaled methacholine, biomarkers of lung injury and inflammation; ex vivo cardiac pathophysiology was assessed at 18 hr only.RESULTS: Overall chemical composition between NR and FR PM was similar, although NR samples comprised larger amounts of PM, endotoxin, and certain metals than did the FR samples. Each PM size fraction showed differences in ratios of major chemical classes. Both NR and FR coarse PM produced significant pulmonary inflammation irrespective of distance, whereas both NR and FR ultrafine PM induced cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.CONCLUSIONS: On a comparative mass basis, the coarse and ultrafine PM affected the lung and heart, respectively.

Leg pain is a frequent accompaniment to back pain and is an indicator of the severity and prognosis of the disorder. For optimal patient care, treatment should be directed according to the identified pathophysiological mechanisms. The authors have proposed a sub-classification of neural low back-related leg pain into four categories, each requiring a different management strategy: Central Sensitization (CS), comprising major features of sensitization of the somatosensory system; Denervation (D), arising from significant axonal compromise without evidence of major central nervous system changes; Peripheral Nerve Sensitization (PNS), arising from nerve trunk inflammation without clinical evidence of significant denervation; and Musculoskeletal pain (M), referred from non-neural structures such as the disc or facet joints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interrater reliability of this classification system. Forty consecutive patients with unilateral low back-related leg pain were independently assessed by five pairs of examiners using a physical examination protocol, screening for central sensitization of the somatosensory system, neurological deficit, and nerve tissue mechano-sensitization. Subjects were classified as follows: CS 30%, D 27.5%, PNS 10%, and M 32.5%. Interrater reliability was good with 80% agreement and a k of 0.72 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) .57-.86).

Recent studies demonstrated increases in inflammatory components in gut mucosa of PI-IBS patients even after complete resolution of infection. We aimed to investigate histological changes in colon and rectum of PI-IBS subjects after long term period of infection.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited PI-IBS subjects who had been diagnosed IBS after complete resolution of enteritis caused by shigellosis outbreak 3 years earlier. We compared unmatched four groups, PI-IBS (n = 4), non PI-IBS (n = 7), D-IBS (n = 7, diarrhea predominant type) and healthy controls (n = 10). All of them underwent colonoscopic biopsy at three areas, including descending colon (DC), sigmoid colon (SC) and rectum, which were assessed for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)/peptide YY (PYY)-containing enterochromaffin (EC) cell, intraepithelial (IEL) and lamina propria T lymphocyte (CD3), CD8 lymphocytes, mast cells and CD68/calprotectin+ macrophages.RESULTS: All subjects had no structural or gross abnormalities at colonoscopy. In PI-IBS, 5-HT containing EC cells, PYY containing EC cells, IELs, CD3 lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes, mast cells, and CD68 + macrophages were increased compared to control (p < 0.05). In D-IBS, PYY containing EC cells, IELs, and CD3 lymphocytes were increased compared to control (p < 0.05). In PI-IBS, 5-HT containing EC cells tended to increase and PYY containing EC cells, CD8 lymphocytes, mast cells, and CD68+ macrophages were increased compared to non PI-IBS (p < 0.05). Calprotectin + marcrophages were decreased in PI-IBS, non PI-IBS and IBS compared to control.CONCLUSION: The immunoendocrine cells were sporadically increased in PI-IBS, non PI-IBS and D-IBS compared with control.

The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) encompasses all levels of cognitive decline associated with CVD from mild deficits in one or more cognitive domains to crude dementia syndrome. VCI incorporates the complex interactions among classic vascular risk factors (i.e. arterial hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes), CVD subtypes, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. VCI may be the earliest, commonest, and subtlest manifestation of CVD and can be regarded as a highly prevalent and preventable syndrome. However, cognition is not a standardized outcome measure in clinical trials assessing functional ability after stroke. Furthermore, with the exception of anti-hypertensive medications, the impact of either preventive or acute stroke treatments on cognitive outcome is not known. Although clinical, epidemiological, neuroimaging, and experimental data support the VCI concept, there is a lack of integrated knowledge on the role played by the most relevant pathophysiological mechanisms involved in several neurological conditions including stroke and cognitive impairment such as excitotoxicity, apoptosis, mitochondrial DNA damage, oxidative stress, disturbed neurotransmitter release, and inflammation. For this reason, in 2006 the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the Canadian Stroke Network (CSN) defined a set of data elements to be collected in future studies aimed at defining VCI etiology, clinical manifestations, predictive factors, and treatment. These recommendations represent the first step toward developing diagnostic criteria for VCI based on sound knowledge rather than on hypotheses.

Demographic, imaging and laboratory data were obtained at the time of presentation. For the long-term survival analysis, the social security death index was used to determine all-cause mortality.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HsCRP levels among AAS patients.RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 4.3% for AAS patients. HsCRP levels differed significantly among AAS; the median hsCRP was higher in the aortic dissection group (49 mg/l) than in those with penetrating aortic ulcer (28 mg/l), symptomatic aortic aneurysm (14 mg/l), and intramural haematoma (10 mg/l); (p=0.02). In multivariable analysis, aortic dissection patients had higher hsCRP levels than intramural haematoma (p=0.03) and symptomatic aortic aneurysm (p=0.04) patients, after adjusting for age and gender. Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that elevated hsCRP levels at presentation were associated with a higher long-term mortality (p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AAS, those with aortic dissection have the highest hsCRP levels at presentation.

This study aimed to determine plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of S100B in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and to correlate S100B levels with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, ICH volumes, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and survival rate, and to correlate CSF S100B levels with plasma S100B levels as well as CSF interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) levels.METHODS: Ten patients with suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage and 38 patients with spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage were included in the study. Their plasma and CSF samples were collected. The concentrations of IL-1β in CSF and S100B in plasma and CSF were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Plasma or CSF S100B levels in the ICH group were significantly higher than those in the control group (178.7±74.2 versus 63.2±23.0 pg/ml; P<0.001 or 158.1±70.9 versus 1.8±0.7 ng/ml; P<0.001). S100B levels were highly associated with GCS scores, ICH volumes, presence of IVH, and survival rate (all P<0.05). CSF S100B levels were highly associated with plasma S100B levels as well as CSF IL-1β levels (both P<0.01) in patients with ICH. A receiver operating characteristic curve identified CSF and plasma S100B cutoff levels that predicted 1-week mortality of patients with a high sensitivity and specificity. The areas under curves (AUCs) of GCS scores and ICH volumes were larger than those of CSF and plasma S100B levels, but the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: High levels of S100B are present in the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood of patients with ICH and may contribute to the inflammatory processes of ICH. The levels of CSF and plasma S100B after spontaneous onset of ICH seem to correlate with clinical outcome in these patients. Increases in peripheral S100B properly reflect brain injury, and plasma S100B level may serve as a useful clinical marker for evaluating the prognosis of ICH.",2010,Brain injury Inflammation Interleukin1 beta Intracerebral hemorrhage Intraventricular hemorrhage Pathogenesis S100B,"[""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China (Huang M, Hu YY); Department of Neurosurgery, First Hangzhou Municipal People's Hospital, 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou 310000, China (Dong XQ, Yu WH, Zhang ZY)."", ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China (Huang M, Hu YY); Department of Neurosurgery, First Hangzhou Municipal People's Hospital, 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou 310000, China (Dong XQ, Yu WH, Zhang ZY)."", ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China (Huang M, Hu YY); Department of Neurosurgery, First Hangzhou Municipal People's Hospital, 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou 310000, China (Dong XQ, Yu WH, Zhang ZY)."", ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China (Huang M, Hu YY); Department of Neurosurgery, First Hangzhou Municipal People's Hospital, 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou 310000, China (Dong XQ, Yu WH, Zhang ZY)."", ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China (Huang M, Hu YY); Department of Neurosurgery, First Hangzhou Municipal People's Hospital, 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou 310000, China (Dong XQ, Yu WH, Zhang ZY).""]",['eng'],['World journal of emergency medicine'],['China'],"[['Huang', 'Man'], ['Dong', 'Xiao-Qiao'], ['Hu', 'Yue-Yu'], ['Yu', 'Wen-Hua'], ['Zhang', 'Zu-Yong']]",['Journal Article'],"['Brain', 'injury', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin', 'beta', 'Intracerebral', 'hemorrhage', 'Intraventricular', 'hemorrhage', 'Pathogenesis', 'SB']",2000s,90-2010s

There is an increasing body of evidence linking inflammation to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular conditions including AF. Historical evidence supports an association between AF and inflammation and is consistent with the association of AF with inflammatory conditions of the heart, such as myocarditis and pericarditis. AF has been associated with myocardial oxidative stress, and antioxidant agents have demonstrated antiarrhythmic benefit in humans. Increased plasma interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma viscosity support the existence of an inflammatory state among ""typical"" populations with chronic AF. These indexes of inflammation are related to the prothrombotic state and may be linked to the clinical characteristics of the patients (underlying vascular disease and comorbidities), rather than simply to the presence of AF itself. It has been suggested that inflammation may have a role in the development of atrial arrhythmias after cardiac surgery, and that a genetic predisposition to develop postoperative complications exists. Cytokines can have a prognostic significance; IL-6 levels, CRP, and other cytokines may have prognostic value in AF.

The pathological hallmarks of MS are lesions of both white and grey matter in the central nervous system. The onset of the disease is usually around 30 years of age. The patients experience an acute focal neurologic dysfunction which is not characteristic, followed by partial or complete recovery. Acute episodes of neurologic dysfunction with diverse signs and symptoms will then recur throughout the life of a patient, with periods of partial or complete remission and clinical stability in between. Currently, there are several therapeutic options for MS with disease-modifying properties. Immunomodulatory therapy with interferon beta-1b (IFN-β1b) or -1a, glatiramer and natalizumab shows similar efficacy; in a resistant or intolerant patient, the most recently approved therapeutic option is mitoxantrone. IFN-β1b in patients with MS binds to specific receptors on surface of immune cells, changing the expression of several genes and leading to a decrease in quantity of cell-associated adhesion molecules, inhibition of major histocompatibility complex class II expression and reduction in inflammatory cells migration into the central nervous system. After 2 years of treatment, IFN-β1b reduces the risk of development of clinically defined MS from 45% (with placebo) to 28% (with IFN-β1b). It also reduces relapses for 34% (1.31 exacerbations annually with placebo and 0.9 with higher dose of IFN-β1b) and makes 31% more patients relapse-free. In secondary-progressive disease annual rate of progression is 3% lower with IFN-β1b.

PEP005 is a broad range activator of the classical (α, β, γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, θ) protein kinase C isoenzymes. Direct pro-apoptotic effects of this drug have been demonstrated in several malignant cells, including melanoma cell lines and primary human acute myelogenous leukemia cells. At micromolar concentrations required to kill melanoma cells this agent causes PKC-independent secondary necrosis. In contrast, the killing of leukemic cells occurs in the nanomolar range, requires activation of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) and is specifically associated with translocation of PKCδ from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane. However, in addition to this pro-apoptotic effect the agent seems to have immunostimulatory effects, including: (i) increased chemokine release by malignant cells; (ii) a general increase in proliferation and cytokine release by activated T cells, including T cells derived from patients with chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia; (iii) local infiltration of neutrophils after topical application with increased antibody-dependent cytotoxicity; and (iv) development of specific anti-cancer immune responses by CD8(+) T cells in animal models.

It has been suggested that aberrant production of various cytokines due to viral infection are associated with virus-induced asthma. However, the mechanisms of how respiratory viruses induce and exacerbate asthma have yet to be clarified. To examine cytokine responses to PIV infection, we assessed 27 cytokine levels released from PIV-infected human fetal lung fibroblasts. In addition, we examined relationships between these cytokine responses and signaling pathways (IκB kinase and p38 MAPK) in PIV-infected cells. At 24 h after infection, PIV-infected cells significantly released a number of cytokines, namely, proinflammatory cytokines [interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α], anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1ra), Th1 cytokines (interferon-γ, and IL-2), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10), granulopoiesis-inducing cytokines (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), neutrophil recruitment-inducing cytokines (IL-8 and interferon-inducible protein-10), and eosinophil recruitment-inducing cytokines (eotaxin and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted).

In recent years, maternal periodontal disease has been implicated as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is conflicting evidence to support such an outcome as illustrated by descriptive, case control and randomised controlled trials involving pregnant women from across the world, using different measurement tools to determine the level of periodontal disease. Whilst considering the literature, there is evidence for both arguments, based on the effect of periodontal inflammatory by products. Bacteria associated with periodontal disease are not dissimilar to those known to be associated with genito-urinary bacterial infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several groups have demonstrated the apparent translocation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonus gingivalis, Treponema denticola to the foetal placental unit whereby a maternal or foetal response has been detected resulting in premature birth or low birthweight. The normal process of parturition involves a cascade of events including a build-up of inflammatory mediators as linked to inflammation, whereby the maternal environment becomes hostile and threatens the well-being of the infant, and the foetus expelled. The question remains therefore, is there a greater risk of delivering a PTLBW infant when the mother has detectable periodontal disease, or is the release of inflammatory mediators and their translocation via the haematogenous route sufficient to induce a poor pregnancy outcome? The data investigated would suggest that there is a positive outcome when certain oral gram-negative bacteria create a cumulative effect sufficient to trigger early delivery, which represents the final straw to result in preterm or low birthweight delivery.

In this article, we briefly review the important contributions of these techniques to understand the role of body composition in the pathogenesis of obesity-related complications. Notably, these imaging techniques have contributed greatly to recent findings identifying gender and racial differences in body composition and patterns of body composition change during weight loss. Although these techniques have the ability to generate good-quality body composition data, each possesses limitations. For example, DEXA is unable to differentiate type of fat, CT has better resolution but provides greater ionizing radiation exposure, and MRI tends to require longer imaging times and specialized equipment for acquisition and analysis. With the serious need for efficacious and cost-effective therapies to appropriately identify and treat at-risk obese individuals, there is greater need for translational tools that can further elucidate the interplay between body composition and the metabolic aberrations associated with obesity.

Obesity represents an abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue resulting from chronic overnutrition and reduced physical activity. The nature of this increased accumulation of fat tissue, whether hyperplasia or hypertrophy, local or ectopic, is associated with deleterious perturbations including excess fatty acid secretion, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, and abnormal adipocyte hormone signaling resulting in insulin resistance. In the setting of obesity, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation is postulated to play a role in development of type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related comorbidities including obstructive sleep apnea, hepatic steatosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

The intensity of exercise as well as the type of exercise is important in producing symptoms. This may make some types of exercise such as swimming more suitable and extended running more difficult for patients with this condition. A better understanding of EIB will allow the physician to direct the patient towards a type of exercise and medications that can result in a more active lifestyle without the same concern for resulting symptoms. This is especially important for schoolchildren who are usually enrolled in physical education classes and elite athletes who may desire to participate in competitive sports. Fortunately several medications (short- and long-acting beta(2)-agonists, cromolyn, nedocromil, inhaled corticosteroids, and more recently leukotriene modifiers) have been shown to be effective in preventing or attenuating the effects of exercise in many patients. In addition, inhaled beta(2)-agonists have been shown to quickly reverse the airway obstruction that develops in patients and continue to be the reliever medications of choice. Inhaled corticosteroids are increasingly being recommended as regular therapy now that the role of inflammation and airway injury has been identified in EIB.

The left ankle joint was injected intraarticularly with water-soluble C60 (20 mul) in the C60-treated group, while, as a control, the left ankle joint in the control rats received phosphate-buffered saline (20 mul), once weekly for eight weeks. Ankle joint tissues were prepared for histological analysis. In adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, intra-articular treatment with C60 in vivo reduced synovitis and alleviated bone resorption and destruction in the joints, while control ankle joints showed progression of synovitis and joint destruction with time.

This can induce inflammation within the periapical area. Therefore, instrumentation that causes less extrusion of debris is more desirable. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the quantity of debris extruded from the apical foramen during root canal preparation by using one hand, and two rotary instrumentation techniques.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different groups each with 12 mesiobuccal roots of human maxillary first molar were instrumented using either step-back technique with hand instruments, FlexMaster or Mtwo rotary system. Debris extruded from the apical foramen during canal preparation was collected. The mean dry weights of debris were compared using one-way ANOVA.RESULTS: Step-back group had a significantly greater mean weight of debris compared to the other two groups (P<0.05).

Macrophages are important immune cells in response to T. vaginalis infection. In this study, we investigated whether human macrophages could be involved in inflammation induced by T. vaginalis. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) were co-cultured with T. vaginalis. Live, opsonized-live trichomonads, and T. vaginalis lysates increased proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 by HMDM. The involvement of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathway in cytokine production induced by T. vaginalis was confirmed by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB. In addition, stimulation with live T. vaginalis induced marked augmentation of nitric oxide (NO) production and expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) levels in HMDM. However, trichomonad-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha production in macrophages were significantly inhibited by inhibition of iNOS levels with L-NMMA (NO synthase inhibitor). Moreover, pretreatment with NF-kappaB inhibitors (PDTC or Bay11-7082) caused human macrophages to produce less TNF-alpha. These results suggest that T. vaginalis stimulates human macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and NO.

These changes were confirmed at ultrastructural level, including vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and atrophied mitochondria with ill-differentiated cisternae, dense collection of macrophages and lymphocytes as well as fibrocytes with collagenous fibrils manifesting early sign of fibrosis, especially in response to cisplatin and doxorubicin -treatment.

Inflammation in middle ear disease is related to ET dysfunction, and postoperative restoration of middle ear integrity and hearing are closely related to ET function in chronic ear disease patients. After successful tympanoplasty, restoration of a well-aerated middle ear with good ET function can permit better compliance of the tympanic membrane. In this study, we evaluated the predictive validity of preoperative ET function measurements.METHODS: We reviewed 137 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty. All patients had non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media and received canal wall-up-type tympanomastoidectomies. Patients were categorized into four groups according to preoperative ET function measurements using a modified pressure inflation-deflation equilibration test. Group I patients had residual pressures less than 10 daPa, and Group IV patients showed no pressure change (poor results). Groups II and III were intermediate. Hearing levels were determined using pure tone averages at four frequencies. Postoperative tympanography was performed to determine middle ear aeration.RESULTS: The preoperative air bone (AB) gap was 29.6+/-7.0 dB, and the postoperative gap was 16.5+/-5.7 dB; thus, there was significant overall improvement. In all groups, hearing was significantly better after surgery, but the worst postoperative hearing level was seen in Group IV patients. Type B tympanograms were more frequently recorded in Group IV patients than they were in Group I or II patients. Postoperative AB gaps were 9.2+/-3.8 dB in patients with type A tympanograms, 13.4+/-2.1 dB in those with type As, 24.1+/-2.5 dB in those with type C, and 18.5+/-2.8 dB in those with type B.CONCLUSION: ET function measured with a modified pressure equilibration test using an inflation-deflation manometric method is a good indicator of an aerated middle ear and is predictive of improved postoperative hearing.",2009,Acoustic impedance tests Eustachian tube Hearing Middle ear ventilation Tympanic membrane perforation Tympanoplasty,"['Department of Otolaryngology, Jeju National University Hospital, Jeju National University, College of Medicine, Jeju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology'],['Korea South'],"[['Choi', 'Seung Hyo'], ['Han', 'Ju Hee'], ['Chung', 'Jong Woo']]",['Journal Article'],"['Acoustic', 'impedance', 'tests', 'Eustachian', 'tube', 'Hearing', 'Middle', 'ear', 'ventilation', 'Tympanic', 'membrane', 'perforation', 'Tympanoplasty']",2000s,90-2010s

Acquired or inherited mutations of the mitochondrial genome DNA may give rise to mitochondrial diseases. Another class of disorders, in which mitochondrial impairments are initiated by extramitochondrial factors, includes neurodegenerative diseases and syndromes resulting from typical pathological processes, such as hypoxia/ischemia, inflammation, intoxications, and carcinogenesis. Both classes of diseases lead to cellular energetic depression (CED), which is characterized by decreased cytosolic phosphorylation potential that suppresses the cell's ability to do work and control the intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and its redox state. If progressing, CED leads to cell death, whose type is linked to the functional status of the mitochondria. In the case of limited deterioration, when some amounts of ATP can still be generated due to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondria launch the apoptotic cell death program by release of cytochrome c. Following pronounced CED, cytoplasmic ATP levels fall below the thresholds required for processing the ATP-dependent apoptotic cascade and the cell dies from necrosis. Both types of death can be grouped together as a mitochondrial cell death (MCD). However, there exist multiple adaptive reactions aimed at protecting cells against CED. In this context, a metabolic shift characterized by suppression of OXPHOS combined with activation of aerobic glycolysis as the main pathway for ATP synthesis (Warburg effect) is of central importance. Whereas this type of adaptation is sufficiently effective to avoid CED and to control the cellular redox state, thereby ensuring the cell survival, it also favors the avoidance of apoptotic cell death. This scenario may underlie uncontrolled cellular proliferation and growth, eventually resulting in carcinogenesis.",2009,cancer energy depression hypoxia inflammation mitochondria mitochondrial cell death neurodegenerative diseases,"['Department of Pathophysiology, University of Tartu, Estonia. enn.seppet@ut.ee <enn.seppet@ut.ee>']",['eng'],['International journal of molecular sciences'],['Switzerland'],"[['Seppet', 'Enn'], ['Gruno', 'Marju'], ['Peetsalu', 'Ants'], ['Gizatullina', 'Zemfira'], ['Nguyen', 'Huu Phuc'], ['Vielhaber', 'Stefan'], ['Wussling', 'Manfred H P'], ['Trumbeckaite', 'Sonata'], ['Arandarcikaite', 'Odeta'], ['Jerzembeck', 'Doreen'], ['Sonnabend', 'Maria'], ['Jegorov', 'Katharina'], ['Zierz', 'Stephan'], ['Striggow', 'Frank'], ['Gellerich', 'Frank N']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']","['cancer', 'energy', 'depression', 'hypoxia', 'inflammation', 'mitochondria', 'mitochondrial', 'cell', 'death', 'neurodegenerative', 'diseases']",2000s,90-2010s

With the advent of more effective anti-retroviral therapies, HIVE has shifted from a sub-acute to a chronic condition. The neurodegenerative process in patients with HIVE is characterized by synaptic and dendritic damage to pyramidal neurons, loss of calbindin-immunoreactive interneurons and myelin loss. The mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in HIVE might involve a variety of pathways, and several lines of investigation have found that interference with signaling factors mediating neuroprotection might play an important role. These signaling pathways include, among others, the GSK3beta, CDK5, ERK, Pyk2, p38 and JNK cascades. Of these, GSK3beta has been a primary focus of many previous studies showing that in infected patients, HIV proteins and neurotoxins secreted by immune-activated cells in the brain abnormally activate this pathway, which is otherwise regulated by growth factors such as FGF. Interestingly, modulation of the GSK3beta signaling pathway by FGF1 or GSK3beta inhibitors (lithium, valproic acid) is protective against HIV neurotoxicity, and several pilot clinical trials have demonstrated cognitive improvements in HIV patients treated with GSK3beta inhibitors. In addition to the GSK3beta pathway, the CDK5 pathway has recently been implicated as a mediator of neurotoxicity in HIV, and HIV proteins might activate this pathway and subsequently disrupt the diverse processes that CDK5 regulates, including synapse formation and plasticity and neurogenesis. Taken together, the GSK3beta and CDK5 signaling pathways are important regulators of neurotoxicity in HIV, and modulation of these factors might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients suffering from HIVE.

Although great progress has been made in this area, results from clinical trials are disappointing and safer and more effective approaches are required. To this end, biological agents used for therapeutic neovascularization must be explored beyond the current well-investigated classes.

Despite advances in the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, treatment remains a challenge.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the production of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes in the brain stem of adolescent rats, using an experimental model of migraine, and the effect of sumatriptan pretreatment on the production of the NOS enzymes.METHODS: Male adolescent (aged ~2 months) Wistar rats were used in the study. The animals were anesthetized using pentobarbital. The trigeminovascular system was stimulated by injecting a proinflammatory molecule, carrageenan, into the cis-terna magna of the anesthetized rats. The animals were divided into 3 groups of equal size: (1) the study group, in which the rats were treated with sumatriptan succinate 2 hours before intracisternal carrageenan injection; (2) the sham group, in which the rats were not administered intracisternal carrageenan injection or sumatriptan pretreatment; and (3) the control group, in which the rats were administered intracisternal carrageenan injection but were not pretreated with sumatriptan. In the control and study groups, the rats were euthanized using ether anesthesia 1 hour after intracisternal carrageenan injection. Rats in the sham group were euthanized 1 hour after intracisternal catheterization. Brain tissue was removed and endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) immunohistochemistry was performed.RESULTS: Twenty-one rats were randomized into 3 groups of 7. The mean values of the immunolabeling intensities for eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS enzymes in the brain stem were significantly lower in the sham group compared with the control group (P = 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.001, respectively).

All exposures were carried out at equal surface area doses.RESULTS: Only nickel oxide (NiO) and alumina 2 caused significant lung inflammation when instilled into rat lungs at equal surface area, suggesting that these two had extra surface reactivity. We observed significant free radical generation with 4 of 13 metal oxides, only one of which was inflammogenic. Only 3 of 13 were significantly hemolytic, two of which were inflammogenic.CONCLUSIONS: Potency in generating free radicals in vitro did not predict inflammation, whereas alumina 2 had no free radical activity but was inflammogenic. The hemolysis assay was correct in predicting the proinflammatory potential of 12 of 13 of the particles examined.

Growth and reproduction are metabolically expensive and carry other costs that contribute to aging. Therefore, animals have developed physiologic strategies to assess the harshness of the environment before devoting resources to reproduction. Presumably, these strategies maximize the possibility for offspring survival. Current views of aging reflect a trade-off between reproductive fitness and somatic maintenance whereby environmental stress induces an adaptive metabolic response aimed at preserving cellular integrity while inhibiting growth, whereas favorable environmental conditions (abundance of food and water, and optimal temperature, etc.) promote growth and reproductive maturity but simultaneously increase cellular damage and aging. Here we propose that the prevalence of infectious pathogens in a given niche represents an additional environmental factor that, via innate immune pathways, actively shifts this balance in favor of somatic maintenance at the expense of reproduction and growth.

However, for CDNPs with high organic content, OxPot could not explain the observed inflammatory response, possibly due to shielding of the OxPot of the carbon core of CDNPs by an organic coating. On the other hand, a pathway-specific gene expression screen indicated that, for particles rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) enzyme-mediated biotransformation of bio-available organics may generate oxidative stress and thus enhance the in vivo inflammatory response.CONCLUSION: The compensatory nature of both effects (shielding of carbon core and biotransformation of PAHs) results in a good correlation between inflammatory response and BET surface area for all CDNPs.

The following reviews: 1) the physical aspects of spinal-implant debris and 2) the local and systemic biologic responses to implant debris.METHODS: Methods included are: 1) gravimetric wear analysis; 2) SEM and LALLS; 3) metal-ion analysis; 4) ELISA, toxicity testing, patch testing; and 5) metal-lymphocyte transformation testing (metal-LTT).RESULTS: Wear and corrosion of spine-implants produce particles and ions. Particles (0.01-1000 μm) are generally submicron ( <1 µm). Wear rates of metal-on-polymer and metal-on-metal disc arthroplasties are approximately 2-20 and 1 mm(3)/yr, respectively. Metal-on-metal total disc replacement components have significant increases in circulating metal (less than 10-fold that of controls at 4 ppb-Co and 3 ppb-Cr or ng/mL). Debris reactivity is local and systemic. Local inflammation is caused primarily by ingestion of debris by local macrophages, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGE2. Systemic responses associated with implant-debris have been limited to hypersensitivity reactions. Elevated amounts of in the liver, spleen, etc of patients with failed TJA have not been associated with remote toxicological or carcinogenic pathology to date. Implant debris are differentially bioreactive. Greater numbers are pro-inflammatory; the smaller-sized debris are more bioreactive by virtue of their greater numbers (dose) for a given amount of implant mass loss (one 100-μm-diameter particle is equivalent in mass to 1 million 1-μm-diameter particles). Elongated particles are pro-inflammatory (ie, aspect ratio of greater than 3). Metal particles are more proinflammatory than polymers, ceteris paribus.CONCLUSION: Spinal arthroplasty designs have been in use for more than 20 years internationally; therefore, concerns about neuropathology, toxicity, and carcinogenicity are mitigated.

To explore sepsis-induced inflammation in Type 2 diabetes, polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a spontaneous animal model of Type 2 diabetes. The Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, non-diabetic inbred rats, were used as controls for the experiment. Blood glucose levels were measured at basal, 2 hr and 20 hr after CLP. At 20 hr after CLP, blood and tissue samples were collected. Plasma levels of lactate, IL-6, IL-10 and endotoxins were measured. Total RNA from liver tissues were extracted and subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using rat specific IL-6 primers. GK rats exhibited significantly elevated basal glucose levels compared to WKY rats. Glucose levels in septic GK rats were significantly elevated compared to WKY rats at all time points studied. While both WKY and GK rats showed significant increases in IL-6 at 20 hr after CLP, the GK rats exhibited an average 2.68-fold increase than that of WKY rats. At 20 hr after CLP, hepatic IL-6 gene expression in GK rats was 1.77-fold greater than that of WKY rats. Although, both WKY and GK rats showed significant increases in plasma lactate levels at 20 hr after CLP, the GK rats exhibited an average increase of 1.69-fold, from the already elevated basal levels, than that of WKY rats. Since the lactate levels in GK sham groups were slightly higher than that of WKY sham, the relative changes in the fold induction by CLP between strains were similar.

Recent studies have suggested the involvement of the pro-inflammatory secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2))-IIA in atherogenesis. This enzyme is produced by different cell types through stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is detectable in the intima and in media smooth muscle cells, not only in atherosclerotic lesions but also in the very early stages of atherogenesis. sPLA(2)-IIA can hydrolyse the phospholipid monolayers of low density lipoproteins (LDL). Such modified LDL show increased affinity to proteoglycans. The modified particles have a greater tendency to aggregate and an enhanced ability to insert cholesterol into cells. This modification may promote macrophage LDL uptake leading to the formation of foam cells. Furthermore, sPLA(2)-IIA is not only a mediator for localized inflammation but may be also used as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes. An interaction between activated RAS and phospholipases has been indicated by observations showing that inhibitors of sPLA(2) decrease angiotensin (Ang) II-induced macrophage lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, various interactions between Ang II and oxLDL have been demonstrated suggesting a central role of sPLA(2)-IIA in these processes and offering a possible target for treatment.

Implication of an association would greatly facilitate cardiac risk prediction, assessment and monitoring.METHODS: 1383 asymptomatic individuals (795 men, 588 women) attending for executive health screening were examined clinically as well as with phlebotomy and exercise stress testing to determine their ten-year risk of developing overt cardiovascular disease (as estimated by both Framingham and SCORE calculations). The significance of their association with overall WBC and subtypes were determined using both univariate and multiple regression modeling.RESULTS: OF ALL WBC SUBTYPES, MONOCYTE COUNT WAS FOUND TO HAVE THE STRONGEST, INDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP WITH OVERALL CVD RISK BY BACKWARDS LINEAR REGRESSION MODELING (FRAMINGHAM: beta = 0.057; p = 0.03; SCORE: beta = 0.128; p = <0.0005).

Highly prevalent coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-77) accumulate in adipose tissue because of their lipophilicity and increase with obesity. However, the effects of PCBs on adipocytes, obesity, and obesity-associated cardiovascular disease are unknown.OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined in vitro and in vivo effects of PCB-77 on adipocyte differentiation, proinflammatory adipokines, adipocyte morphology, body weight, serum lipids, and atherosclerosis.METHODS: PCB-77 or 2,2',4,4,5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) was incubated with 3T3-L1 adipocytes either during differentiation or in mature adipocytes. Concentration-dependent effects of PCB-77 were contrasted with those of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). For in vivo studies, we treated C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)(-/-) mice with vehicle or PCB-77 (49 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal injection) and examined body weight gain. In separate studies, we injected ApoE(-/-) mice with vehicle or PCB-77 over a 6-week period and examined body weight, adipocyte size, serum lipids, and atherosclerosis.RESULTS: Low concentrations of PCB-77 or TCDD increased adipocyte differentiation, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, whereas higher concentrations inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Effects of PCB-77 were abolished by the AhR antagonist alpha-naphthoflavone. PCB-77 promoted the expression and release of various proinflammatory cytokines from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Administration of PCB-77 increased body weight gain in WT but not AhR(-/-) mice. ApoE(-/-) mice injected with PCB-77 exhibited greater body weight, adipocyte hypertrophy, serum dyslipidemia, and augmented atherosclerosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PCB-77 may contribute to the development of obesity and obesity-associated atherosclerosis.",2008,adipocyte differentiation aryl hydrocarbon receptor ectopic lipid deposition obesity polychlorinated biphenyl,"['Graduate Center for Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",['eng'],['Environmental health perspectives'],"['United States', 'United States', 'United States']","[['Arsenescu', 'Violeta'], ['Arsenescu', 'Razvan I'], ['King', 'Victoria'], ['Swanson', 'Hollie'], ['Cassis', 'Lisa A']]","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']","['adipocyte', 'differentiation', 'aryl', 'hydrocarbon', 'receptor', 'ectopic', 'lipid', 'deposition', 'obesity', 'polychlorinated', 'biphenyl']",2000s,90-2010s

In particular, the adhesion molecules (integrins) mediate the selective binding between the leukocytes and the endothelial cells regulating the migration of leukocytes into the normal and inflamed intestine. Selective adhesion molecule inhibitors interfere with the migration of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation by targeting adhesion molecules (alpha4-integrin or alpha4beta7-integrin). Natalizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-alpha4-integrin monoclonal antibody that inhibits both alpha4beta7-integrin/mucosal addressin-cell adhesion molecule-1 (MadCAM-1) interaction and alpha4beta1/vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) binding. Pooled data from the four studies, analyzed in a Cochrane review, suggest that natalizumab is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD. In particular, natalizumab may be beneficial for patients with active inflammation or chronically active disease despite the use of conventional therapies with high level of C-reactive protein values at baseline time.

To assess the potential role, if any, of Th-17 cells in autism, we analyzed plasma samples obtained from children ranging in age from 2-5 years with a diagnosis of autism and age-matched typically developing controls for the presence of IL-17 and IL-23 cytokines.

In this study, we were able to demonstrate that IL-23 cytokine levels were significantly different in children with autism compared with age-matched controls, a finding primarily driven by children with early onset autism. In contrast, there were no statistical differences in IL-17 levels autism compared with age-matched typically developing controls.

After 6 weeks of treatment, the plasma levels of lipid peroxides (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), ceruloplasmin (CP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), uric acid (UA) and glutathione (GSH) were detected using colorimetric methods. The plasma levels of PGE2 were measured using ELISA assay. The plasma levels of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) were determined using atomic absorption spectrometer.RESULTS: In CII treated group, the levels of LPO, NO, PGE2, UA, CP and Cu were significantly higher, but the levels of SOD, GSH and Zn were significantly lower than controls. In CII + Allo treated group, the levels of SOD and GSH were significantly increased, but the levels of PGE2, LPO, NO, UA, Cu and CP were significantly decreased in comparison with CII-treated group. The levels of SOD, GSH and Zn were significantly increased, but the levels of PGE2, NO and CP were significantly decreased in the vitamin E treated group in comparison with CII-treated group. The levels of PGE2, LPO, Cu and Zn were significantly lower in vitamin E treated group than Allo-treated group.

The most important risk factors are inflammation, DIC, impaired liver function, fluctuations in cardiac output, and congenital heart disease, as well as exogenous risk factors such as central venous or arterial catheters. In most clinically symptomatic infants, diagnosis is made by ultrasound, venography, or CT or MRI angiograms. However, clinically asymptomatic vessel thrombosis is sometimes picked up by screening investigations or during routine imaging for other indications. Acute management of thrombosis and thromboembolism comprises a variety of approaches, including simple observation, treatment with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, as well as more aggressive interventions such as thrombolytic therapy or catheter-directed revascularization.

We used mice deficient for Smad3, a central part of the major signal transduction pathway for TGF-beta and other related cytokines, and a mouse model for allergic asthma with ovalbumin (OVA) as the antigen. Compared to wild type mice, naive (unmanipulated) Smad3-/- mice exhibited significantly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and IL-4 as well as the Th2 associated transcription factor GATA-3 in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In the asthma model, mucin secretion and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) after allergen exposure was significantly increased in the Smad3-/- mice as compared to wild type (WT) mice. IL-4 levels in Smad3-/- were similar to those encountered in WT mice but IL-13 levels were decreased in the airways of OVA sensitized Smad3-/- mice compared to corresponding WT mice. The results indicate that a lack of Smad3 dependent signalling in the normal state will lead to an increase in the GATA-3 levels and as a result of this the levels of IL-4 increase. However, the lack of Smad3 also seems to inhibit expression of some cytokines, especially IL-13.

Traditionally, ERK are associated with the regulation of proliferation and differentiation as well as survival of various cell types. Their activity is controlled by phosphorylation on specific aminoacidic residues, which is induced by a variety of external cues, including growth-promoting factors.In the nervous system, ERK phosphorylation is induced by binding of neurotrophins to their specific tyrosine kinase receptors or by neuronal activity leading to glutamate release and binding to its ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Some studies have provided evidence of its importance in neuroplastic events. In particular, ERK phosphorylation in the spinal cord was shown to be nociceptive-specific and its upregulation, occurring in cases of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain, seems to be of the utmost importance to behavioural changes observed in those conditions. In fact, experiments using specific inhibitors of ERK phosphorylation have proved that ERK directly contributes to allodynia and hyperalgesia caused by spinal cord injury or chronic pain.

Skin manifestations were observed in 23/36 patients (63.9%) and pathergy test was found positive in 14/36 patients (38.9%). Other manifestations included central nervous system involvement, recurrent genitourinary inflammations, arthralgias and superficial thrombophlebitis.

Chemokines and their receptors are therefore considered to mediate inflammation and tissue damage in autoimmune disorders. Chemokine receptor (CCR) genotypes were recently identified, and the importance of their genetic polymorphisms in some autoimmune and infectious disorders has been demonstrated. To define the roles of the polymorphism of the CCR2 gene at codon 64 (CCR2-64I) and the 32-bp deletion in the coding region of CCR5 (CCR5Delta32) in Korean patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), we compared these genotypes in MG cases and healthy controls and investigated the clinical features associated with these genotypes.METHODS: One hundred and fifteen healthy controls (51 men and 64 women) and 109 MG patients (44 men and 65 women) from three University hospitals were included. We examined each patient for clinical features using electrophysiology tests, laboratory tests, and thymic pathology. The CCR2-64I and CCR5Delta32 polymorphisms were determined by the PCR-RFLP method.RESULTS: We detected no difference in the frequencies of CCR2-64I polymorphism between MG patients and healthy controls. All of the MG patients and the healthy controls were homozygous for the wild-type CCR5 genotype. The results of electrophysiological tests and thymic pathologies were not influenced by the type of CCR2-64I polymorphism. However, the anti-acetylcholine-receptor (AChR) antibody titer was higher in the CCR2 G/G genotype (13.34+/-12.71 nmol/L) than in the CCR2 A/A genotype (5.83+/-2.56 nmol/L).CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an increased risk for MG associated with the CCR2-64I and CCR5Delta32 polymorphisms.

There was strong early consensus that exercise-induced reductions in inflammation were explained by body mass index or body fatness, but recent studies provide support for the contention that exercise has body fat-independent anti-inflammatory effects. With few exceptions, the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise appear to occur regardless of age or the presence of chronic diseases. What remains unclear are the mechanisms by which exercise training induces these anti-inflammatory effects, but there are several intriguing possibilities, including release of endogenous products, such as heat shock proteins; selective reduction of visceral adipose tissue mass or reducing infiltration of adipocytes by macrophages; shift in immune cell phenotype; cross-tolerizing effects; or exercise-induced shifts in accessory proteins of toll-like receptor signaling. However, future research endeavors are likely to uncover additional potential mechanisms, and it could be some time before functional mechanisms are made clear.

In an ideal scenario, cardiovascular biomarkers and imaging combined will provide a better diagnostic tool to identify high-risk individuals and also more efficient methods for effective therapies to reduce such cardiovascular risk. However, additional studies are required in order to show that this approach can contribute to improved diagnostic and therapeutic of atherosclerotic disease.",2007,Atherosclerosis Biomarkers Inflammation Metalloproteinases Proteolysis Vulnerable plaque,"['Atherosclerosis Research, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Biomarker insights'],['United States'],"[['Páramo', 'José A'], ['Rodríguez Ja', 'José A'], ['Orbe', 'Josune']]",['Journal Article'],"['Atherosclerosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Inflammation', 'Metalloproteinases', 'Proteolysis', 'Vulnerable', 'plaque']",2000s,90-2010s

These effects of IL-1 and LPS have been shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX).OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between induction of COX-2 in the brain with IL-1beta- and LPS-induced changes in body temperature, plasma corticosterone and feeding.METHODS: Mice were injected with intraperitoneal doses of IL-1beta and LPS that decreased feeding. The induction of COX-2 was studied immunocytochemically in the brain, in parallel with core body temperature, the drinking of sweetened milk, and plasma concentrations of corticosterone.RESULTS: COX-2 immunoreactivity (ir) was sparse in the brains of the untreated mice, but IL-1beta and LPS both increased its expression. This COX-2 induction appeared to be confined to blood vessels, and was not markedly region specific. Induction was evident 30 min after IL-1 or LPS, and was greater at 90 than at 30 min. COX-2-ir in the parenchyma did not change significantly. Thus induction of COX-2 occurred in brain endothelia in parallel with the reduction in feeding. This is consistent with the previously determined sensitivity of IL-1-induced changes in feeding to selective COX-2 inhibitors, and the responses to IL-1 in COX-2-deficient mice. The time courses of the IL-1- and LPS-induced increases in plasma corticosterone paralleled those in the reduction in milk drinking, however, the changes in body temperature appeared later.CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial COX-2 may be involved in IL-1- and LPS-induced decreases in milk drinking, and possibly in the HPA axis activation. The decreased milk drinking may occur when IL-1 and LPS bind to receptors on brain endothelial cells subsequently inducing COX-2 and the production of prostanoids which elicit the reductions in milk drinking. Thus the behavioral effects of peripherally administered IL-1 and LPS appear to be mediated by multiple mechanisms, including endothelial COX-2, and vagal afferents.",2006,Behavior Corticosterone Cyclooxygenase2 Endothelia Feeding Interleukin1 Lipopolysaccharide,"['Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Neuroscience, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA 71130-3932, USA. adunn@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],['Neuroimmunomodulation'],"['United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'Switzerland']","[['Dunn', 'Adrian J'], ['Swiergiel', 'Artur H'], ['Zhang', 'Hao'], ['Quan', 'Ning']]","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']","['Behavior', 'Corticosterone', 'Cyclooxygenase', 'Endothelia', 'Feeding', 'Interleukin', 'Lipopolysaccharide']",2000s,90-2010s

As a range-finding acute study, we first compared pulmonary responses between SD and F344 strains after a single nose-only exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke or LPS. Secondly, F344 rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 or 13 weeks under the comparable daily exposure dose (WTPM concentration x daily exposure duration; according to Haber's rule) but at a different WTPM concentration or daily exposure duration. Blood carboxylhemoglobin was increased linearly to the WTPM concentration, while urinary nicotine plus cotinine value was higher for the longer daily exposure than the corresponding shorter exposure groups. Gamma glutamyl transferase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was increased dose dependently after 2 and 13 weeks of cigarette smoke exposure, while the neutrophil content in BALF was not increased notably. Smoke-exposed groups showed reduced body weight gain and increased relative lung and heart weights. While BALF parameters and the relative lung weights suggest pulmonary responses, histopathological examination showed epithelial lesions mainly in the upper respiratory organs (nose and larynx).

We previously demonstrated that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and the S1P receptor S1PR3 are intimately involved in lung inflammatory responses and vascular barrier regulation. Furthermore, plasma S1PR3 protein levels were shown to serve as a biomarker of severity in critically ill ARDS patients. This study explores the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the S1PR3 gene to sepsis-associated ARDS. S1PR3 SNPs were identified by sequencing the entire gene and tagging SNPs selected for case-control association analysis in African- and ED samples from Chicago, with independent replication in a European case-control study of Spanish individuals. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, luciferase activity assays, and protein immunoassays were utilized to assess the functionality of associated SNPs. A total of 80 variants, including 29 novel SNPs, were identified. Because of limited sample size, conclusive findings could not be drawn in African-descent ARDS subjects; however, significant associations were found for two promoter SNPs (rs7022797 -1899T/G; rs11137480 -1785G/C), across two ED samples supporting the association of alleles -1899G and -1785C with decreased risk for sepsis-associated ARDS. In addition, these alleles significantly reduced transcription factor binding to the S1PR3 promoter; reduced S1PR3 promoter activity, a response particularly striking after TNF-α challenge; and were associated with lower plasma S1PR3 protein levels in ARDS patients.

Minocycline turns black when oxidized, leading to discoloration of the skin, nails, bulbar conjunctiva, oral mucosa, teeth, bones, and thyroid gland. Hyperpigmentation has been reported after long-term minocycline therapy with at least 100 mg/day. Three types of minocycline-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation can result. Type I is the most common, and is associated with blue-black discoloration in areas of previous inflammation and scarring. Type II most commonly affects the legs and is characterized by blue-gray pigmentation of previously normal skin. Type III is the least common and is characterized by diffuse muddy-brown discoloration predominantly on sun exposed skin.

Apelin, a small regulatory peptide, is the endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor. Apelin and APJ are expressed in the pancreas. The aims of this study were to examine whether apelin influences the inflammatory and fibrosis responses to pancreatitis in mice and to identify mechanisms behind apelin's activities. Supramaximal cerulein induction of AP or CP caused significant (P < 0.05) elevations in pancreatic apelin and APJ expression. Levels declined during the recovery phases. In apelin gene-knockout mice with pancreatitis, pancreatic neutrophil invasion and myeloperoxidase activity were enhanced significantly, and apelin treatment suppressed both. Apelin exposure reduced CP-induced elevations of extracellular matrix-associated proteins. Apelin inhibited PDGF-simulated connective tissue growth factor production and proliferation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and keratinocyte cytokine levels were higher in apelin gene-knockout than wild-type mice with pancreatitis. Apelin reduced AP- and CP-induced elevations in pancreatic NF-κB activation. Together, these findings imply that the pancreatic apelin-APJ system functions to curb the inflammatory and fibrosis responses during pancreatitis. Furthermore, findings suggest that apelin reduces inflammation and fibrosis by reducing neutrophil recruitment and PSC activity. Inhibition of neutrophil invasion may be mediated by reduced keratinocyte cytokine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor secretion. Apelin-induced reductions in PSC proliferation and connective tissue growth factor production are putative mechanisms underlying apelin's inhibition of extracellular matrix production.

Sugars with their three-dimensional structures are important for many biological functions. We report preparation of negatively charged pectin nanoparticles encapsulating paclitaxel, a broad-spectrum anticancer drug for possible therapeutic applications. The mean diameter of the nanoparticles was ~300-350 nm with an encapsulation efficiency ~17 %. The TEM studies indicated that the particles were spherical in shape and their sizes are in unison with the DLS size spectra. The surface charge of pectin polymer was -5 mV and of nanoparticles were ~ -32 mV. The enhanced surface charge shows greater stability. The high electrophoretic mobility of ~3.5 to 1.5 μmcm/Vs confirmed the nano-size of particles. We compared the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel (Pax) per se, pectin nanoparticles (PPN), and pectin chains on Hep G2, hepatic carcinoma cell line. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed, wherein ~21.7 ± 3.2 % cytotoxicity was observed by PPN, but Pax per se showed ~55.6 ± 3.5 % cytotoxicity in a 72-h assay.

MMPs have outgrown the field of extracellular matrix biology and have progressed toward being important regulatory molecules in inflammation, and hence are key components in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. This rise in status has led to the development of MMP inhibitors which can act as switches or delicate tuners in acute and chronic inflammation and the regenerative phase after inflammation. The new challenge in MMP research is to better understand the complex role these enzymes play in periodontal disease and to design inhibitors that are successful in the clinic. Perioceutics or the use of the pharmacological agents specifically developed to manage periodontitis is an interesting and emerging aid in the management of periodontal diseases along with mechanical debridement.

For instance cannabinoids have been shown to reduce susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and attenuate HIV replication in macrophages. Recently, we demonstrated that alcohol induces cannabinoid receptors and regulates cytokine production by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC). However, the ability of alcohol and cannabinoids to alter MDDC function during HIV infection has not been clearly elucidated yet. In order to study the potential impact of alcohol and cannabinoids on differentiated MDDC infected with HIV, monocytes were cultured for 7 days with GM-CSF and IL-4, differentiated MDDC were infected with HIV-1Ba-L and treated with EtOH (0.1 and 0.2%), THC (5 and 10 μM), or JWH-015 (5 and 10 μM) for 4-7 days. HIV infection of MDDC was confirmed by p24 and Long Terminal Repeats (LTR) estimation. MDDC endocytosis assay and cytokine array profiles were measured to investigate the effects of HIV and substances of abuse on MDDC function. Our results show the HIV + EtOH treated MDDC had the highest levels of p24 production and expression when compared with the HIV positive controls and the cannabinoid treated cells. Although both cannabinoids, THC and JWH-015 had lower levels of p24 production and expression, the HIV + JWH-015 treated MDDC had the lowest levels of p24 when compared to the HIV + THC treated cells. In addition, MDDC endocytic function and cytokine production were also differentially altered after alcohol and cannabinoid treatments.

In total, 20 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal saline (NS group) and a bleomycin group (BLM group). The BLM group rats were intratracheally instilled with BLM, while the NS group rats were intratracheally instilled with saline. In each group, half the rats were sacrificed at day 7 and day 28, respectively, following intratracheal instillation. Subsequently, hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining were performed to observe the pathological changes in the lung tissue, while the expression of IL-17A in the lung tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected and divided into two sections. One section was used for cell counting and classification, and an ELISA was performed to detect the concentration of IL-17A in the BALF. The additional section was used to separate, purify and cultivate alveolar macrophages (AMs). The concentration of IL-17A in the cultivating supernatant was detected by ELISA, and the mRNA expression levels of IL-17A in the AMs were detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results revealed that a considerable number of inflammatory cells had infiltrated into the alveolar cavity in the BLM group at day 7, and less alveolitis and more serious fibrosis were observed at day 28, as compared with the NS group. Furthermore, when compared with the NS group, the protein expression levels of IL-17A in the lung tissue were markedly higher in the BLM group at days 7 and 28 (higher at day 7; P<0.05). In addition, the total number of BALF cells in the BLM group was clearly higher at day 7 when compared with the NS group (P<0.05), although a normal level was re-established by day 28. The level of IL-17A in the BALF increased significantly at days 7 and 28 in the BLM group; however, when compared with the level at day 7, the concentration had decreased at day 28. When compared with the NS group, the protein expression levels of IL-17A in the BLM group were notably higher after 12, 24 and 48 h. In addition, the results of the RT-PCR assay revealed that the mRNA expression levels of IL-17A increased significantly at days 7 and 28 in the BLM group when compared with the NS group (P<0.05).

Epidemiological evidence consistently shows that obesity is associated with a similar or mildly increased incidence of prostate cancer but, more prominently, an increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Studies in mice demonstrate that obesity induced by high-fat feeding increases prostate cancer progression; however, the mechanisms underpinning this relationship remain incompletely understood. Adipose tissue expansion in obesity leads to local tissue dysfunction and is associated with low-grade inflammation, alterations in endocrine function and changes in lipolysis that result in increased delivery of fatty acids to tissues of the body. The human prostate gland is covered anteriorly by the prominent peri-prostatic adipose tissue and laterally by smaller adipose tissue depots that lie directly adjacent to the prostatic surface. We discuss how the close association between dysfunctional adipose tissue and prostate epithelial cells might result in bi-directional communication to cause increased prostate cancer aggressiveness and progression. However, the literature indicates that several 'mainstream' hypotheses regarding obesity-related drivers of prostate cancer progression are not yet supported by a solid evidence base and, in particular, are not supported by experiments using human tissue.

Direct phenotypical analysis of the cellular compartment is critical to better understand the OA disease process. This study provides proof-of-principle for flow cytometry-based phenotyping of isolated subchondral trabecular bone (STB) marrow cells without prior use of cell culture techniques.METHODS: Tibial plateaus were obtained from OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Subchondral bone chips were digested with collagenase IA and single cell suspensions were directly phenotyped using flow cytometry. Cells were analyzed for the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as osteoblast/osteoprogenitor marker and monocyte/macrophage markers (CD14, CD68, HLA-DR, CD115).RESULTS: MTT staining revealed abundant viable cells in the bone marrow compartment of STB prior to digestion, which were efficiently released by collagenase. Within the CD45-negative cell fraction, approximately 20% of the cells were positive for the early osteoblast/osteoprogenitor marker ALP. Within the CD45+ hematopoietic cell fraction, the majority of cells were of monocytic origin (>80%) displaying strong surface expression of CD14. Discreet macrophage populations (CD14+/HLA-DR+/CD68+) and putative osteoclast progenitors (CD45+/HLA-DR-/CD115+) were unequivocally identified. Osteoblast, macrophage and osteoclast progenitor presence in the subchondral bone unit (SBU) was confirmed by (immuno)histochemical staining for osteocalcin, CD68 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric analysis is a valuable methodology to study the cellular compartment of STB marrow.

One of the core components of the immune system is the NF-κB pathway, which plays an essential role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity. Remarkably, the NF-κB pathway received only little attention in bipolar studies, as opposed to studies of related psychiatric disorders where immune dysregulation has been proposed to explain the neurodegeneration in patient conditions.

Luteolin is a bioflavonoid with many beneficial properties such as antioxidant, antiproliferative, and anti-cancer.OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the potential anti-inflammatory response and the underlying mechanism of luteolin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the mixture of tumor necrosis factor-α, lipopolysaccharide, and interferon-γ (TLI) in the presence or absence of luteolin. We performed Griess' method for nitric oxide (NO) production and measure mRNA and protein expressions by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively.RESULTS: Luteolin opposed the stimulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NO production by simultaneous treatment of adipocytes with TLI. Furthermore, it reduced the pro-inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, resistin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Furthermore, luteolin improved the insulin sensitivity by enhancing the expression of insulin receptor substrates (IRS1/2) and glucose transporter-4 via phosphatidylinositol-3K signaling pathway.

In addition, luteolin blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal Kinases and also p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate that luteolin attenuates inflammatory responses in the adipocytes through suppression of NF-κB and MAPKs activation, and also improves insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that luteolin may represent a therapeutic agent to prevent obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance.",2015,3T3L1 adipocytes inflammation luteolin mitogenactivated protein kinases nuclear factorκB obesity,"['Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 561-756, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Medical School, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 561-756, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 561-756, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 561-756, Korea.', 'Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Wonkwang-Oriental Medicines Research Institute, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk, 570-749, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 561-756, Korea.']",['eng'],['Pharmacognosy magazine'],['India'],"[['Nepali', 'Sarmila'], ['Son', 'Ji-Seon'], ['Poudel', 'Barun'], ['Lee', 'Ji-Hyun'], ['Lee', 'Young-Mi'], ['Kim', 'Dae-Ki']]",['Journal Article'],"['TL', 'adipocytes', 'inflammation', 'luteolin', 'mitogenactivated', 'protein', 'kinases', 'nuclear', 'factorκB', 'obesity']",2010s,2010-now

TBI also occurs frequently in a military setting where exposure to blast waves is common. Abnormal gene expression involved with oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal apoptosis has been well documented following blast induced neurotrauma (BINT). Altered epigenetic transcriptional regulation through DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathology of the injury. Imbalance between DNA methylation and DNA demethylation may lead to altered methylation patterns and subsequent changes in gene transcription. DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) are responsible for the addition of methyl groups to DNA, DNA methylation. Whereas the combined function of ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3) and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) result in the removal of methyl groups from DNA, DNA demethylation. We used an established rodent model of BINT to assess changes in DNA methylation and demethylation enzymes following injury. Three different blast overpressures were investigated (10, 17 and 23psi). Gene expression was investigated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus two weeks following injury. We observed DNMT, TET and TDG expression changes between pressure groups and brain regions. The hippocampus was more vulnerable to enzyme expression changes than the prefrontal cortex, which correlated with aberrant DNA methylation. A significant negative correlation was found between global DNA methylation and the magnitude of blast overpressure exposure. Through transcriptional regulation, altered DNA methylation patterns may offer insight into the characteristic outcomes associated with the injury pathology including inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. As such, these enzymes may be important targets to future therapeutic intervention strategies.

Although there are probably multifactorial mechanisms that result in compromized stem cell functionality with advancing age, the accumulation of DNA damage within the stem cell compartment is likely to make a major contribution to this process. However, the physiologic source of DNA damage within the different tissue specific stem cell compartments remains to be determined, as does the fate of stem cells exposed to such damage. Using the haematopoietic system as a model organ, we have recently shown that certain forms of physiologic stress, such as infection-associated inflammation and extensive blood loss, leads to the induction of biologically relevant levels of DNA damage in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by dramatically increasing the proliferative index of this normally quiescent cell population. (1) We were also able to demonstrate that such stress-associated DNA damage was sufficient to completely deplete HSCs and promote severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in the Fanconi anemia (FA) knockout mouse model, which has compromized replication-associated DNA repair. In this ""Extra Views"" article, we extend this previous work to show that FA mice do not spontaneously develop a haematopoietic phenotype consistent with SAA, even at extreme old age. This suggests that HSC quiescence restricts the acquisition of DNA damage during aging and preserves the functional integrity of the stem cell pool. In line with this hypothesis, we provide an extended time course analysis of the response of FA knockout mice to chronic inflammatory stress and show that enforced HSC proliferation leads to a highly penetrant SAA phenotype, which closely resembles the progression of the disease in FA patients.

Studies investigating the efficacy of NTT as a biologic modifier immunosuppressant medication for ACU, refractory to topical and/or systemic steroid therapy, were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measure was the improvement of intraocular inflammation, as defined by the SUN working group criteria. We determined a combined estimate of the proportion of subjects responding to NTT.RESULTS: We initially identified 526 articles, of which 89 were potentially eligible. From the selection process, a total of 10 retrospective chart reviews and a randomized single-blind controlled study, providing a total of 12 children and 34 adults, were deemed eligible: 3 articles looked at rituximab, 3 at abatacept, 3 at tocilizumab, and the remaining 1 at alemtuzumab and the other at anakinra. Before the NTT treatment, all the eligible subjects received several combinations of one or more DMARDs and at least one anti-TNF strategy.

Desloratadine is a novel, long-acting inhibitor of histamine. However, very little is known about the effect of desloratadine citrate disodium injection (DLC injection) on AR, and the underlying mechanisms are yet unexplored. Herein, we sought to explore the effects and mechanisms of actions of DLC injection in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced immune responses in a rat model of AR.METHODS: Sixty rats were subjected to immunization with OVA (intraperitoneal [i.p.]), followed by a nasal challenge with OVA. Drugs or saline were given daily for treatment. Nasal symptoms and histology of the nasal mucosa were examined. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-γ, adhesion molecules such as soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Nitric oxide (NO) concentration was also measured by NO assay kit.RESULTS: DLC treatment (intravenous [i.v.]) significantly decreased the frequency of sneezing and nasal scratching and alleviated nasal inflammation by increasing the serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-12, while lowering the expression of IL-4. Thus, DLC (i.v.) treatment led to a marked elevation in T-helper 1/T-helper 2 (Th1/Th2) ratio when administered in the AR rats. The expression of sVCAM-1, iNOS, and NO were also reversed.CONCLUSION: DLC (i.v.), given after an allergen challenge, improved Th1 cytokines level and restrained Th2 responses alleviating the symptoms of AR.

Articles from 2009 to the present dealing with prevalence, morbidity and treatment of asthma-COPD overlap were identified and reviewed.RESULTS: Asthma-COPD overlap was consistently recognised in studies using a variety of different study designs and sampling. The prevalence was approximately 20% in patients with obstructive airways diseases. Asthma-COPD overlap was associated with increased morbidity and possibly an increased mortality and comorbidity. There was evidence of a heterogeneous pattern of airway inflammation that included eosinophilic (in adult asthma), neutrophilic or mixed patterns (in severe asthma and COPD). Systemic inflammation was present in asthma-COPD overlap and resembled that of COPD. Within asthma-COPD overlap, there is evidence of different subgroups, and recognition using bronchodilator responsiveness has not been successful. Guidelines generally recommend a serial approach to assessment, with treatment recommendations dominated by an asthma paradigm. Research is needed into key clinical features that impact outcome, mechanisms and treatment approaches in asthma-COPD overlap. Identifying and treating disease components by multidimensional assessment shows promise.CONCLUSIONS: Asthma-COPD overlap has drawn attention to the significant heterogeneity that exists within obstructive airway diseases.

Although there are a growing number of studies describing use of incisional NPWT in a variety of applications, including vascular, cardiac and orthopaedic, a literature search revealed few studies regarding incisional NPWT use post body-contouring surgery. In a clinical study of seroma formation, less seroma and haematoma formation was reported in post-bariatric patients who received incisional NPWT, versus the control, following body-contouring surgery. In another study of widely applied external NPWT wound dressings over the ventral and lateral trunk following post-bariatric abdominal dermolipectomy, results showed a significant reduction in exudate formation, earlier drain removal, and decreased length of hospitalisation, compared with conventional treatment. Additional controlled studies are needed to validate the clinical impact of incisional NPWT following body-contouring surgery, and to determine proper recommendations for its use.

It is a common feature of chronic illnesses and a significant number of both adults and children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) suffer from fatigue. Reliable, validated fatigue scales have been developed for use in ITP. These will facilitate future investigation of its pathogenesis and the effectiveness of intervention. Acute inflammation acts on neural and endocrine systems resulting in 'sickness behaviour', an adaptive response to infection and injury. Inflammation is also thought to cause fatigue in chronic disease and immune dysregulation in ITP appears to have a number of pro-inflammatory components.

MPO-dependent oxidation of lipoproteins has been implicated in foam cell formation, dysfunctional HDL, and abnormalities in reverse cholesterol transport. Whole leaf extract of O. tenuiflorum and its major components, eugenol and ursolic acid, inhibit the oxidation of lipoproteins by myeloperoxidase/copper as measured by conjugated diene formation as well as by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay. Whole basil leaf extract is able to attenuate the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells compared with its components.

However, TNF inhibitors are not useful for one third of all patients (i.e. ""primary failures""), and further one third lose effect over time (""secondary failures""). Therefore, other strategies have in later years been developed including monoclonal antibodies targeting the interleukin (IL)-6 family of receptors (the p40 subunit of IL-12/IL-23) as well as monoclonal antibodies inhibiting adhesion molecules (the α4β7 heterodimers), which direct leukocytes to the intestinal mucosa. Recently, small molecules, which are inhibitors of Janus kinases (JAKs), hold promise with a tolerable safety profile and efficacy in UC, and the field of nanomedicine is emerging with siRNAs loaded into polyactide nanoparticles that may silence gene transcripts at sites of intestinal inflammation.

Improved organ preservation techniques will decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) contributing to PGD. Adult bone marrow-derived adherent stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), have potent anti-inflammatory actions, and we thus postulated that intratracheal MAPC administration during donor lung processing would decrease IRI. The goal of the study was therefore to determine if intratracheal MAPC instillation would decrease lung injury and inflammation in an ex vivo human lung explant model of prolonged cold storage and subsequent reperfusion.METHODS: Four donor lungs not utilized for transplant underwent 8 h of cold storage (4°C). Following rewarming for approximately 30 min, non-HLA-matched allogeneic MAPCs (1 × 10(7) MAPCs/lung) were bronchoscopically instilled into the left lower lobe (LLL) and vehicle comparably instilled into the right lower lobe (RLL). The lungs were then perfused and mechanically ventilated for 4 h and subsequently assessed for histologic injury and for inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue.RESULTS: All LLLs consistently demonstrated a significant decrease in histologic and BALF inflammation compared to vehicle-treated RLLs.CONCLUSIONS: These initial pilot studies suggest that use of non-HLA-matched allogeneic MAPCs during donor lung processing can decrease markers of cold ischemia-induced lung injury.",2014,Cell therapy Ischemiareperfusion injury Lung transplantation Mesenchymal stromal cell,"['Cardiac Surgery and Cardiopulmonary Transplantation, DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center, The Houston Methodist, Houston, TX USA ; Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology, Inc, Holliston, MA USA.', 'Athersys Inc, Cleveland, OH USA.', 'Department of Nanomedicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX USA.', 'Department of Nanomedicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 226 Health Science Research Facility, Burlington, VT USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 226 Health Science Research Facility, Burlington, VT USA.', 'Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 226 Health Science Research Facility, Burlington, VT USA.', 'Athersys Inc, Cleveland, OH USA.', 'Athersys Inc, Cleveland, OH USA.', 'Athersys Inc, Cleveland, OH USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 226 Health Science Research Facility, Burlington, VT USA.']",['eng'],['Transplantation research'],"['United States', 'United States', 'United States', 'England']","[['La Francesca', 'Saverio'], ['Ting', 'Anthony E'], ['Sakamoto', 'Jason'], ['Rhudy', 'Jessica'], ['Bonenfant', 'Nicholas R'], ['Borg', 'Zachary D'], ['Cruz', 'Fernanda F'], ['Goodwin', 'Meagan'], ['Lehman', 'Nicholas A'], ['Taggart', 'Jennifer M'], ['Deans', 'Robert'], ['Weiss', 'Daniel J']]",['Journal Article'],"['Cell', 'therapy', 'Ischemiareperfusion', 'injury', 'Lung', 'transplantation', 'Mesenchymal', 'stromal', 'cell']",2010s,2010-now

A delineation of the mechanisms that underlie the inappropriate renal and tubular inflammation can thus provide important insights into potential therapies for cisplatin-induced AKI. Rho-kinases are known to act as molecular switches controlling several critical cellular functions, including cell migration, cytokine production, and apoptosis. Here, we show that the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil attenuated cisplatin nephrotoxicity, resulting in less histological damage, improved renal function, and the infiltration of fewer leukocytes into the kidney. Renal nuclear factor-κB activation and apoptosis were reduced, and the expressions of proinflammatory renal cytokine and chemokine mRNA were decreased. Urinary and renal kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) expression was also reduced, a finding that is consistent with diminished kidney injury. In the current study, we also showed that fasudil could be protective of the impaired tubules. In vitro, fasudil reduced the apoptosis (annexin-V+PI cells) and cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor+ cells) in T cells and the apoptosis (annexin-V+PI cells) and tubular damage (Kim-1+ cells) in proximal tubular cells by flow cytometric analysis.

The myotoxicity is predominantly associated with neurotoxic effects and is a cause of mortality and morbidity. In this study, pharmacological effects of venoms were investigated in vitro on neuromuscular transmission.MAIN METHODS: Effects of Androctonus mauretanicus (Am) and Buthus occitanus (Bo) venoms were investigated using the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparations.

All of these pathways converge to lead to axon dysfunction and symptoms of neuropathy. The detailed mechanisms of axon degeneration itself have begun to be elucidated with studies of animal models with altered degeneration kinetics, including the slowed Wallerian degeneration (Wld(S)) and Sarm knockout animal models. These studies have shown axonal degeneration to occur through a programmed pathway of injury signaling and cytoskeletal degradation.

Since glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans act as chemokine co-receptors in inflammation, we have used a CXCL8-based dominant-negative mutant, dnCXCL8, to displace neutrophil-related chemokines in murine lungs using models of lung inflammation. Treatment with dnCXCL8 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide after intravenous, subcutaneous and intratracheal administration. A strong and significant therapeutic effect was achieved already at a dose of 40 µg/kg of dnCXCL8. A similar dose response, but showing a broader spectrum of reduced inflammatory cells and soluble inflammatory markers, was observed in a murine model of tobacco smoke (TS)-induced lung inflammation. The broad spectrum of reduced inflammatory cells and markers can be due to the strong inhibition of neutrophil extravasation into the lung parenchyma, and/or to a relatively broad protein displacement profile of dnCXCL8 which may compete not only with wtCXCL8 for glycosaminoglycan-binding but possibly also with other related glycosaminoglycan-binding pro-inflammatory chemokines.

One of OAs main risk factors is obesity. To date, it is not fully understood how obesity results in OA. Historically, this link was ascribed to excessive joint loading as a result of increased body weight. However, the association between obesity and OA in non-weight-bearing joints suggests a more complex aetiology for obesity-induced OA. In the present review, the link between obesity and OA is discussed. First, the historical view of altered joint loading leading to wear and tear of the joint is addressed. Subsequently, the effects of a disturbed lipid metabolism, low-grade inflammation, and adipokines on joint tissues are discussed and linked to OA. Taken together, inflamed adipose tissue and dyslipidaemia play pivotal roles in obesity-induced OA. It becomes increasingly clear that the link between obesity and OA transcends excessive loading.

HCV bound to B cell surface receptors can induce lymphoproliferation, leading to DNA mutations and/or lower antigen response thresholds. These findings and epidemiological reports suggest an association between HCV infection and NHL. We performed a systematic review of the literature to clarify this potential relationship. We searched the English-language literature utilizing Medline, Embase, Paper First, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, with search terms broadly defined to capture discussions of HCV and its relationship with NHL and/or lymphoproliferative diseases. References were screened to further identify relevant studies and literature in the basic sciences. A total of 62 reports discussing the relationship between HCV, NHL, and lymphoproliferative diseases were identified. Epidemiological studies suggest that at least a portion of NHL may be etiologically attributable to HCV, particularly in areas with high HCV prevalence. Studies that showed a lack of association between HCV infection and lymphoma may have been influenced by small sample size, short follow-up periods, and database limitations. The association appears strongest with the B-cell lymphomas relative to other lymphoproliferative diseases. Mechanisms by which chronic HCV infection promotes lymphoproliferative disease remains unclear. Lymphomagenesis is a multifactorial process involving genetic, environmental, and infectious factors. HCV most probably have a role in the lymphomagenesis but further study to clarify the association and underlying mechanisms is warranted.

Contrasting frequent employment of dsRNA in epithelial cell cultures there is no information on effects of dsRNA administered to human airways in vivo. Here we explore effects of nasal dsRNA challenges in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis inside and outside Swedish birch pollen season.METHODS: We examined effects of dsRNA in seven patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. By being studied both inside and outside of an active pollen season they served as their own controls. Based on pilot experiments a repeat dose regimen of dsRNA, 4 × 100 μg, was given daily into the right nostril on two consecutive days; left nostril received corresponding saline challenges. Airway cells for gene analyses were obtained by nasal brushing shortly before the first challenge and 48 h after challenges.RESULTS: Pollen counts and nasal symptoms indicated a significant season of allergic rhinitis. At the height of the pollen season, dsRNA challenges increased three antiviral proteins, interferons β and λ1 and IL-32, compared to saline challenges. By contrast, outside the pollen season dsRNA did not increase the expression of these antiviral proteins. dsRNA did not cause any symptoms outside the season nor did it increase the allergic symptoms evoked by natural pollen exposure.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the possibility that active mucosal inflammation, induced by natural allergen exposure in human airways, transiently increases in vivo antiviral responsiveness of airway surface cells.",2014,Allergy Asthma Asthma exacerbation Epithelial cells Rhinitis TLR3,"['Unit of Respiratory Immunopharmacology, Dept.

Moreover, a clear mechanism through which 5-LO influences AAA remains unclear.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Aneurysm formation was attenuated in 5-LO(-/-) mice, and in lethally irradiated wild-type mice reconstituted with 5-LO(-/-) bone marrow in an elastase perfusion model. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-LO-attenuated aneurysm formation in both aortic elastase perfused wild-type and angiotensin II-treated LDLr(-/-) (low-density lipoprotein receptor) mice, with resultant preservation of elastin and fewer 5-LO and MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase)-producing cells. Separately, analysis of wild-type mice 7 days after elastase perfusion showed that 5-LO inhibition was associated with reduced polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration to the aortic wall. Importantly, 5-LO inhibition initiated 3 days after elastase perfusion in wild-type mice arrested progression of small AAA. Human AAA and control aorta corroborated these elastin and 5-LO expression patterns.CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of 5-LO by pharmacological or genetic approaches attenuates aneurysm formation and prevents fragmentation of the medial layer in 2 unique AAA models. Administration of 5-LO inhibitor in small AAA slows progression of AAA.

While potent anti-HIV and antitumoral activities were attributed to BA, it is considered to have a moderate anti-inflammatory activity. Here we evaluated the effects of BA in a mouse model of endotoxic shock. Endotoxemia was induced through intraperitoneally LPS administration, nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines were assessed by Griess method and ELISA, respectively. Treatment of BALB/c mice with BA at 67 mg/kg caused a 100% survival against a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BA treatment caused a reduction in TNF-α production induced by LPS but did not alter IL-6 production. Moreover, BA treatment increased significantly the serum levels of IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated, LPS-challenged mice. To investigate the role of IL-10 in BA-induced protection, wild-type and IL-10(-/-) mice were studied. In contrast to the observations in IL-10(+/+) mice, BA did not protect IL-10(-/-) mice against a lethal LPS challenge. Addition of BA inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by macrophages stimulated with LPS, while promoting a significant increase in IL-10 production. BA-treated peritoneal exudate macrophages produced lower concentrations of TNF-α and NO and higher concentrations of IL-10 upon LPS stimulation. Similarly, macrophages obtained from BA-treated mice produced less pro-inflammatory mediators and increased IL-10 when compared to non-stimulated macrophages obtained from vehicle-treated mice. In conclusion, we have shown that BA has a potent anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, protecting mice against LPS by modulating TNF-α production by macrophages in vivo through a mechanism dependent on IL-10.",2014,Antiinflammatory activity Betulinic acid Cytokines Endotoxemia Macrophages,"['Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Immunopharmacology Gonçalo Moniz Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rua Waldemar Falcão, 121, 40296-750, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Federal University of Paraíba, João Pessoa, Cidade Universitária, s/n, 58051-900, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Federal University of Paraíba, João Pessoa, Cidade Universitária, s/n, 58051-900, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Immunopharmacology Gonçalo Moniz Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rua Waldemar Falcão, 121, 40296-750, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; Department of Life Sciences, State University of Bahia, Rua Silveira Martins, 2555, 41150-000, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Immunopharmacology Gonçalo Moniz Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rua Waldemar Falcão, 121, 40296-750, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Immunopharmacology Gonçalo Moniz Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rua Waldemar Falcão, 121, 40296-750, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; Center of Biotecnology and Cell Therapy, São Rafael Hospital, Av.

The use of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) as a dermal component in a permanent composite skin with human hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) was evaluated by studying the tissue-engineered skin architecture, stem cell persistence, hair regeneration, and graft-take in nude mice. A porcine acellular dermal matrix was seeded with HFSCs alone and with HFSCs plus human DPCs or dermal fibroblasts (DFs). In vitro, the presence of DPCs induced a more regular and multilayered stratified epidermis with more basal p63-positive cells and invaginations. The DPC-containing constructs more accurately mimicked the skin architecture by properly stratifying the differentiating HFSCs and developing a well-ordered epithelia that contributed to more closely recapitulate an artificial human skin. This acellular dermal matrix previously repopulated in vitro with HFSCs and DFs or DPCs as the dermal component was grafted in nude mice. The presence of DPCs in the composite substitute not only favored early neovascularization, good assimilation and remodeling after grafting but also contributed to the neovascular network maturation, which might reduce the inflammation process, resulting in a better healing process, with less scarring and wound contraction.

CDC was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C reactive protein <2.6, Health Assessment Questionnaire <0.5 and change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score ≤0.5. Changes in scores at weeks 26 and 52 for work-related outcomes, Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS), a Visual Analogue Scale measuring pain (VAS-Pain) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) were compared between patient groups defined by achievement of CDC at week 26 using linear regression with adjustment for baseline scores.RESULTS: Patients with RA who achieved CDC at week 26 (n=200) had significantly greater improvements in VAS-Pain (46.9 vs 26.9; p<0.0001), FACIT-F (13.3 vs 7.5; p<0.0001), SF-36 PCS (19.7 vs 8.9; p<0.0001) and SF-36 MCS (8.1 vs 5.0; p=0.0004) than those who did not (n=1267). Results were consistent at week 52 and among methotrexate-naive patients with early RA, methotrexate-experienced patients with late-stage RA and patients with inadequate response to methotrexate.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RA who achieved CDC at week 26 had improved short-term and long-term HRQoL, pain, fatigue and work-related outcomes compared with patients who do not. These results demonstrate that the joint achievement of all CDC components provides meaningful benefits to patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: DE019: NCT00195702, PREMIER: NCT00195702, OPTIMA: NCT00195702.",2015,Inflammation Patient perspective Rheumatoid Arthritis,"['Leeds Institute of Rheumatic & Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Chapel Allerton Hospital and NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],['Annals of the rheumatic diseases'],"['United Kingdom', 'United Kingdom', 'England']","[['Emery', 'Paul'], ['Kavanaugh', 'Arthur'], ['Bao', 'Yanjun'], ['Ganguli', 'Arijit'], ['Mulani', 'Parvez']]","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']","['Inflammation', 'Patient', 'perspective', 'Rheumatoid', 'Arthritis']",2010s,2010-now

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's disease, is a rare disease with a prevalence of about 4 in 100,000. Since 2005 when the anti-Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) NMO autoantibody was discovered by Lennon's group at the Mayo clinic, an enormous amount of data have been acquired on the pathogenesis of the disease. A review of the literature showed 47 relevant publications in 2004, compared with 353 in 2013. The auto-antigen AQP4 is expressed on the astrocytic foot processes suggesting a role for astrocytes in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the astrocytes might play a more active role than has previously been suggested in the immune cascade of NMO pathology. Here we will review epidemiological, clinical diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of NMO and highlight the possible role of astrocytes as major direct and indirect players in the pathogenesis of NMO and related CNS inflammatory diseases.

A total of 86 patients with meningitis, multiple sclerosis, tension-type headache, idiopathic facial nerve palsy (IFNP), affective and schizophrenic disorders were tested for both, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a multiplexed cytokine ELISA for IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-10, IL12p70, IL-13 and IL-17. Cases with viral and bacterial meningitis had unequivocally higher cytokine concentrations in the CSF when compared with serum. Bacterial meningitis was unique by extremely elevated IL-17, TNF-α and IL-1β, indicating a plethora of inflammatory pathways, selectively activated in the CSF. In relapsing multiple sclerosis, IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated in both, serum and CSF, but IL-12p70, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-α were more prominent in serum than in CSF. Qualitatively similar biomarker patterns were detected in patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy and tension-type cephalgia. Affective and schizophrenic disorders clearly present with an inflammatory phenotype in the CSF and also serum, the cytokines determined were in general higher in schizophrenia. Except IFN-γ, schizophrenic patients had higher IL-12p70 and a trend of higher IL-10 and IL-13 in serum suggesting a more prominent TH2-type counter regulatory immune response than in affective disorders. These differences were also mirrored in the CSF. Elevated IL-8 appears to be the most sensitive marker for inflammation in the CSF of all diseases studied, whereas TNF-α was restricted to peripheral blood. With the exception of IL-8, all but viral and bacterial meningitis, studied, displayed higher means of elevated lymphokine concentrations in the serum than in the CSF. This observation supports the concept of immunological crosstalk between periphery and intrathecal immunity in neurological and psychiatric diseases.

Patients were treated for at least 12 months with infliximab (IFX) (3-5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 4-8 weeks) or adalimumab (ADA) (usually 40 mg every 2 weeks). The main outcome measures were degree of anterior and posterior chamber inflammation, visual acuity, macular thickness and immunosuppression load.RESULTS: Sixty-eight men and 56 women (221 affected eyes) were studied. The mean age was 38.6 years (s.d. 10.4). HLA-B51 was positive in 66.1% of patients and uveitis was bilateral in 78.2%. IFX was the first biologic agent in 77 cases (62%) and ADA was first in 47 (38%). In most cases anti-TNF-α drugs were used in combination with conventional immunosuppressive drugs. At the onset of anti-TNF-α therapy, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation was observed in 57% and 64.4% of patients, respectively. In both conditions the damage decreased significantly after 1 year. At baseline, 50 patients (80 eyes) had macular thickening [optical coherence tomography (OCT) >250 μm] and 35 (49 eyes) had cystoid macular oedema (OCT>300 μm) that improved from 420 μm (s.d. 119.5) at baseline to 271 μm (s.d. 45.6) at month 12 (P < 0.01). The best-corrected visual acuity and the suppression load also showed significant improvement. After 1 year of follow-up, 67.7% of patients were inactive.

Various anatomic, pathophysiologic, and environmental changes contribute to SDB. The successful treatment of SDB reverses many of these abnormal processes. The present article discusses the current clinical evidence that supports the reversibility and its potential application in the management of SDB. Continuous positive airway pressure reduces angiogenesis and inflammatory edema, increases pharyngeal size, and improves surrogate markers of vascular inflammation and tongue muscle fiber types. Mandibular advancement devices lead to favorable maxillary and mandibular changes, increase pharyngeal area, and improve hypertension. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty increases posterior airway space and pharyngeal volume, reduces nasal and oral resistance, and lowers response to high CO2. Weight loss reduces nasopharyngeal collapsibility, critical closing pressure of the airway, apnea-hypopnea index, and improves oxygen saturations. Potential clinical benefits of these changes in the management of SDB and patient compliance with treatment are discussed.

A new maxillary sinus ostium (MSO) self-dilation device that functions on the principle of osmosis, absorbing a small amount of fluid from the surrounding tissues, can be placed into the MSO under endoscopic visualization and slowly enlarge its outer diameter. The slower dilation may further minimize tissue damage and scarring compared to the currently available balloon dilation systems. The MSO self-dilating expansion device has never been studied before in clinical trials; the purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and performance of the device in human subjects.METHODS: Twelve chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients presenting with maxillary sinus inflammation requiring FESS were enrolled. The device was inserted into the MSO at the start of surgery and removed after 60 minutes. Endoscopic evaluation for patency was performed immediately after removal, and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Adverse events were recorded intraoperatively and at each subsequent visit.RESULTS: The device was successfully inserted in 100% of cases attempted (19/19 MSOs, 12 patients). Seventeen (89%) devices remained in the MSO for 60 minutes and dilated to a mean diameter of 4.8 ± 0.5 mm. One patient was withdrawn from the study. No adverse events occurred during insertion or removal of the device. At 3 months postinsertion 14 of 15 MSO dilated (93%) were confirmed patent.CONCLUSION: Placement of an osmotic self-dilating expansion device in human MSO is safe, achievable and effective at dilating the ostia.",2014,balloon chronic rhinosinusitis device dilatation feasibility studies maxillary sinusitis,"[""St. Paul's Sinus Centre, St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""]",['eng'],['International forum of allergy & rhinology'],['United States'],"[['Hathorn', 'Iain'], ['Habib', 'Al-Rahim'], ['Santos', 'Rachelle Dar'], ['Javer', 'Amin']]","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['balloon', 'chronic', 'rhinosinusitis', 'device', 'dilatation', 'feasibility', 'studies', 'maxillary', 'sinusitis']",2010s,2010-now

However, because of the low rate (69%) of complete evaluation of the colon and owing to inadequate cleansing. We believe that the method of bowel preparation could be improved by reducing volume. In the present study, we attempted to improve the colon-cleansing regimen in order to optimize the usefulness of CCE-2 in the management of UC patients.METHODS: Twenty patients with histologically confirmed UC were enrolled. Patients took a maximum 2.2 L lavage solution (polyethylene glycol solution and magnesium citrate) in two or three divided doses. To assess the effectiveness of the modified bowel preparation regimen, we evaluated the rate of total colonobservation, the effectiveness of bowel cleansing, andinterobserver agreement in assessing UC disease activity. We used a four-point grading scale (poor, fair, good, and excellent) for evaluating the quality of bowel cleansing. Matts' endoscopic score was used to evaluate disease activity.RESULTS: The rate of total colon observation was 85%, and 15 patients (75%) excreted the CCE-2 within 8 h. The proportion of excellent plus good cleansing was approximately 60%. There was a substantial interobserver agreement (κ = 0.777) in assessment of overall cleansing, which was still substantial at the fair cleansing level (κ = 0.700).CONCLUSION: Using CCE-2, the modified bowel preparation regimen, with reduced volume has the potential to succeed in the evaluation of mucosal severity in UC.",2014,bowel preparation colon capsule endoscopy magnesium citrate polyethylene glycol ulcerative colitis,"['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society'],['Australia'],"[['Usui', 'Shingo'], ['Hosoe', 'Naoki'], ['Matsuoka', 'Katsuyoshi'], ['Kobayashi', 'Taku'], ['Nakano', 'Masaru'], ['Naganuma', 'Makoto'], ['Ishibashi', 'Yuka'], ['Kimura', 'Kayoko'], ['Yoneno', 'Kazuaki'], ['Kashiwagi', 'Kazuhiro'], ['Hisamatsu', 'Tadakazu'], ['Inoue', 'Nagamu'], ['Serizawa', 'Hiroshi'], ['Hibi', 'Toshifumi'], ['Ogata', 'Haruhiko'], ['Kanai', 'Takanori']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['bowel', 'preparation', 'colon', 'capsule', 'endoscopy', 'magnesium', 'citrate', 'polyethylene', 'glycol', 'ulcerative', 'colitis']",2010s,2010-now

Herein, the diagnostic value of 4 natural anticoagulants was assessed, and the prognostic value of antithrombin and protein C were validated in a large population.METHODS: Part 1 study included 126 patients with clinically suspected DIC and estimated plasma levels of 4 candidate anticoagulant proteins: antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and protein Z. Part 2 comprised 1,846 patients, in whom plasma antithrombin and protein C levels were compared with other well-known DIC markers according to the underlying dis eases. The 28-day mortality rate was used to assess prognostic outcome.RESULTS: Antithrombin and protein C showed higher areas under the ROC curve than protein S and protein Z. In part 2 of the study, antithrombin and protein C levels significantly correlated with DIC score, suggesting that these factors are good indicators of DIC severity. Antithrombin and protein C showed significant prognostic power in Kaplan-Meier analyses. In patients with sepsis/severe infection, antithrombin and protein C showed higher hazard ratios than D-dimer. Platelet count showed the highest hazard ratio in patients with hemato logic malignancy. In patients with liver disease, the hazard ratio for antithrombin levels was significantly high.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased plasma anticoagulant levels reflect florid consumption of the physiologic defense system against DIC-induced hypercoagulation.

Conjunctivitis and dry eye are known ocular adverse effects, but uveitis has not been reported.CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old woman had undergone bilateral cataract surgery without complications. Six months after the surgery, she was diagnosed with RA and treated with tocilizumab infusion every 4 weeks. However, severe malaise and dizziness occurred after the third tocilizumab infusion, and the treatment was suspended. Since the symptoms associated with RA had resolved, she was followed without any medication thereafter. At 5 weeks after the third tocilizumab infusion, she developed severe anterior inflammation with hypopyon in her left eye, and her visual acuity dropped to less than 2/200. Considering her age and history of cataract surgery, endophthalmitis was suspected and a vitrectomy was performed, but no pathogens were detected from the intraocular fluid samples collected during surgery. The ocular inflammation was gradually resolved with systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids. However, severe anterior uveitis recurred in the same eye during the tapering of the systemic corticosteroids, when the aqueous humor IL-6 level was 46,100 pg/mL. The recurrent ocular inflammation was resolved with increased doses of topical and systemic corticosteroids, and the patient has since remained relapse-free.

Various traditional herbal remedies for malaria involve plants, proven scientifically to have antiplasmodial effects, e.g., Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Meliaceae).OBJECTIVE: Combination of an artemisinin-based compound and a medicinal herb extract will provide an indigenous alternative/herb-based ACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vivo schizontocidal activity of the crude aqueous extract of 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg of A. indica fresh leaves (NCE) and 6, 15, and 20 mg/kg of artesunic acid were determined, alone and in combination, while keeping the dose of artesunic acid constant at 15 mg/kg, using the Peter's 4-day suppressive test and Swiss albino mice. The ED50 was calculated from the dose-response relationships. Percentage survival and cure were also determined.RESULTS: The average yield of two extractions of NCE was 8.33 ± 1.67%. Combination of 1000 mg/kg of NCE and 15 mg/kg of artesunic acid, produced a significant reduction of parasitemia (96.87%), compared to 20 mg/kg of artesunic acid alone (68.14%). The combination had an ED50 of 0.58 mg/kg while that of artesunic acid alone was 8.814 mg/kg. The combinations of NCE with artesunic acid produced a cure, although the artesunic acid did not produce a cure in 30 d.DISCUSSION: NCE increased the activity of artesunic acid in terms of reduction in parasitemia, and increased survival time and cure rate.CONCLUSION: The combination of an artemisinin and aqueous extract of neem leaf is possible, providing a potentiated reduction of parasitemia, and increased cure rate.",2014,Artemisininbased combination therapy drug resistance malaria parasites,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University , Awka , Nigeria .']",['eng'],['Pharmaceutical biology'],['England'],"[['Anagu', 'Onyeka Linda'], ['Attama', 'Anthony Amaechi'], ['Okore', 'Vincent Chima'], ['Gugu', 'Harrison Thaddeus'], ['Ngene', 'Augustine Arinze'], ['Esimone', 'Charles Okechukwu']]",['Journal Article'],"['Artemisininbased', 'combination', 'therapy', 'drug', 'resistance', 'malaria', 'parasites']",2010s,2010-now

IL-1α, HGF, IP-10, MIP-1α, TRAIL, sCD40L, IL-10, IL-12p70, MCP-3, FGFb, ENA-78, TGF-β, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-15, IL-7 and PDGF-BB decreased below baseline over the course of treatment. Higher BMI, baseline HCV viral load and leptin levels were associated with lack of sustained virologic response. ENA-78 was associated with sustained viral response. Positive correlations were found between liver inflammation and baseline CD4 count, sVCAM and HGF; fibrosis stage and HGF; liver steatosis, BMI and leptin. Our findings suggest IFN/RBV treatment initially increases levels of several biomarkers, but eventually leads to a decline in many immune markers.

SCF is a regulator of mast cell function and growth. However, the critical mechanisms in SCF-directed events remain incompletely defined. Here, we have investigated the role of MKK3 in mast cell SCF signaling-dependent functions by using BMMCs from MKK3-deficient mice. MKK3 was phosphorylated rapidly and persistently following SCF-induced activation and contributed to mast cell proliferation but not survival or migration in response to SCF. Analysis of SCF-induced mast cell mediator secretion demonstrated that IL-6 production is specifically dependent on MKK3 signals, both independently and in concert with IgE. Analysis of SCF-induced signaling showed that sustained p38 phosphorylation was impaired in MKK3-deficient mast cells, where as early JNK and IκBα activation were enhanced. Notably, SCF-inducible expression and activation of c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, was significantly dependent on MKK3. Accordingly, AP-1 DNA-binding activity and interaction with the IL6 gene promoter was markedly impaired in MKK3-deficient mast cells, whereas transcription factors of the Egr family, NF-κB, and NFAT retained near-full activity.

The Th9 cell percentage, transcription factor PU.1 and cytokine interleukin (IL)-9 mRNA levels, as well as IL-9 serum concentration in peripheral circulation, were measured in AD patients, psoriasis patients and healthy controls. The Th9 cell percentage, PU.1 and IL-9 expression levels of AD patients were all increased significantly compared with the other two control groups (P < 0·01), and correlated positively with SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index, serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) levels (P < 0·05). In simple AD patients and AD patients complicated by allergic rhinitis or asthma, there were no significant differences in the Th9 cell percentage, PU.1 and IL-9 expression levels between them.

Correlations between results obtained by flow cytometry and clinical parameters relevant to IgG4-RD were also analysed.Results: The percentage and absolute number of PD-1+CXCR5- cells within total CD4+ T cells in IgG4-RD patients were significantly increased compared with those in healthy volunteers. Further analysis showed that there were marked positive correlations of the percentage of PD-1+CXCR5-CD4+ T cells with the serum level of IgG4 and the number of organs involved.

The present study therefore investigated under in vivo conditions whether administration of lutein attenuates the inflammation-induced hyperexcitability of trigeminal spinal nucleus caudalis (SpVc) neurons that is associated with mechanical hyperalgesia.Results: Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the whisker pads of rats to induce inflammation, and then mechanical stimulation was applied to the orofacial area to assess the threshold of escape. The mechanical threshold was significantly lower in inflamed rats compared to uninjected naïve rats, and this lowered threshold was returned to control levels by 3 days after administration of lutein (10 mg/Kg, i.p.) Also the lutein administration, inflammation-induced thickness of edema was returned to control levels. The mean increased number of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-immunoreactive cells in the whisker pads of inflamed rats was also returned to control levels by administration with lutein. The mean discharge frequency of SpVc wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons to both nonnoxious and noxious mechanical stimuli in inflamed rats was significantly decreased after lutein administration. In addition, the increased mean spontaneous discharge of SpVc WDR in inflamed rats was significantly decreased after lutein administration. Similarly, lutein significantly diminished noxious pinch-evoked mean after discharge frequency and occurrence in inflamed rats. Finally, lutein restored the expanded mean size of the receptive field in inflamed rats to control levels.Conclusion: These results together suggest that administration of lutein attenuates inflammatory hyperalgesia associated with hyperexcitability of nociceptive SpVc WDR neurons via inhibition of the peripheral Cox-2 signaling cascade.

In the context of the brain-gut axis model, colitis can lead to alteration of brain function in a bottom-up manner. Here, the changes in the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inflammation-related markers in the brain in colitis were studied.Methods: Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to generate a mouse model of colitis. Mice were treated with DSS for 3 or 7 days and sacrificed. We analyzed the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the expression of GFAP, in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. Additionally, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum cortisol/corticosterone were measured.Results: Alteration of inflammatory-related markers varied depending on the brain region and exposure time. In the hippocampus, COX-2 mRNA, GFAP mRNA, and GFAP expression were upregulated during exposure to DSS. However, in the hypothalamus, COX-2 mRNA was upregulated only 3 days after treatment. In the amygdala, BDNF and COX-2 mRNAs were downregulated. CRP and corticosterone expression increased with DSS treatment at day 7.Conclusion: IBD could lead to neuroinflammation in a bottom-up manner, and this effect varied according to brain region. Stress-related hormones and serum inflammatory markers, such as CRP, were upregulated from the third day of DSS treatment.

Lipopolysaccharides were injected in situ daily in all groups for 7 days. Mandibular bones were investigated at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery using micro-CT, histological observations, and real-time PCR analysis. At the postoperation, there was more substantial nascent bone in the microcapsule and Bio-oss groups than in the control group. The recovery of the rabbits in the Ca(OH)2 group was slower than the control group, as determined using micro-CT and histological staining. Osteocalcin and collagen type I production was not significantly different between the microcapsule and Bio-oss groups (p > 0.05), but the expression levels of the two molecules were significantly increased compared to the control and Ca(OH)2 groups at postoperation (p < 0.05).

Because Zika virus (ZIKV) has an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs, we investigated the safety and efficacy of a live attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate (ZIKV-LAV) for the treatment of human GBM in a GSC-derived orthotopic model. Intracerebral injection of ZIKV-LAV into mice caused no neurological symptoms or behavioral abnormalities. The neurovirulence of ZIKV-LAV was more attenuated than that of the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus LAV 14-14-2, underlining the superior safety of ZIKV-LAV for potential GBM treatment. Importantly, ZIKV-LAV significantly reduced intracerebral tumor growth and prolonged animal survival by selectively killing GSCs within the tumor. Mechanistically, ZIKV infection elicited antiviral immunity, inflammation, and GSC apoptosis. Together, these results further support the clinical development of ZIKV-LAV for GBM therapy.IMPORTANCE Glioblastoma (GBM), the deadliest type of brain tumor, is currently incurable because of its high recurrence rate after traditional treatments, including surgery to remove the main part of the tumor and radiation and chemotherapy to target residual tumor cells. These treatments fail mainly due to the presence of a cell subpopulation called glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy and capable of self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Because Zika virus (ZIKV) has an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs, we tested a live attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate (ZIKV-LAV) for the treatment of human GBM in a human GSC-derived orthotopic model. Our results showed that ZIKV-LAV retained good efficacy against glioblastoma by selectively killing GSCs within the tumor. In addition, ZIKV-LAV exhibited an excellent safety profile upon intracerebral injection into the treated animals. The good balance between the safety of ZIKV-LAV and its efficacy against human GSCs suggests that it is a potential candidate for combination with the current treatment regimen for GBM therapy.",2018,Zika virus anticancer therapy glioblastoma vaccine,"['State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Risk Assessment and Control Technology for Environment and Food Safety, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Guangzhou No.8 People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurobiology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurobiology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Sealy Center for Structural Biology & Molecular Biophysics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Sealy Center for Structural Biology & Molecular Biophysics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurobiology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Sealy Center for Structural Biology & Molecular Biophysics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA peshi@utmb.edu jhman@ncba.ac.cn qincf@bmi.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China peshi@utmb.edu jhman@ncba.ac.cn qincf@bmi.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China peshi@utmb.edu jhman@ncba.ac.cn qincf@bmi.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['mBio'],"['United States', 'United States', 'United States']","[['Chen', 'Qi'], ['Wu', 'Jin'], ['Ye', 'Qing'], ['Ma', 'Feng'], ['Zhu', 'Qian'], ['Wu', 'Yan'], ['Shan', 'Chao'], ['Xie', 'Xuping'], ['Li', 'Dapei'], ['Zhan', 'Xiaoyan'], ['Li', 'Chunfeng'], ['Li', 'Xiao-Feng'], ['Qin', 'Xiaoling'], ['Zhao', 'Tongyan'], ['Wu', 'Haitao'], ['Shi', 'Pei-Yong'], ['Man', 'Jianghong'], ['Qin', 'Cheng-Feng']]","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]","['Zika', 'virus', 'anticancer', 'therapy', 'glioblastoma', 'vaccine']",2010s,2010-now

Male albino rats were divided to control, rats received a single dose of CP, rats received PER, and rats co-received PER and CP. Nephrotoxicity evoked by CP challenge was characterized histologically and biochemically including significant increase in relative kidney/body weight ratio and serum urea and creatinine. Additionally, CP markedly increased renal tissue content of malondialdehyde (MDA) while decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) and depleted glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. CP produced significant increase in the inflammation biomarkers; nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interlukine-6 (IL-6). Administration of CP clearly upregulated caspase-3, while it downregulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) gene expressions.

Here, we tested several GPCR agonists regarding their ability to activate a MEF2 reporter in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) strongly activated MEF2. Using pharmacological and protein-based inhibitors, we demonstrated that PGE2 regulates MEF2 via the EP3 receptor, the βγ subunit of Gi/o protein and two concomitantly activated downstream pathways. The first consists of Tiam1, Rac1, and its effector p21-activated kinase 2, the second of protein kinase D. Both pathways converge on and inactivate histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and thereby de-repress MEF2. In vivo, endotoxemia in MEF2-reporter mice induced upregulation of PGE2 and MEF2 activation.

Higher NLR and PLR values were found to be associated with advanced stage of the disease, deep myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and nodal involvement. When the cut-off value was considered as 3, sensitivity and specificity for NLR were found to be 68% and 69%, respectively, to predict lymph node metastasis.

Development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) after treatment with other biopharmaceuticals has been thoroughly described, but the induction of ADAs after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors has been inadequately investigated. In this retrospective study, we relate ipilimumab serum levels and anti-ipilimumab antibody levels to clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). Method: Serum samples from 31 patients with MM were analyzed for serum levels of ipilimumab and ADAs to ipilimumab at baseline, and before the 2nd and 4th infusion using an in-house bead-based assay. The results were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Low serum levels of ipilimumab before the 2nd infusion correlated significantly with a shorter OS (p = 0.01) and PFS (p = 0.02). Eight patients (26%) were ADA-positive at either timepoint.

Emerging evidence indicates that a negative microenvironment, particularly one characterized by the acute inflammation/immune response caused by physical injuries or transplanted stem cells, severely impacts the survival of transplanted stem cells. In this study, to avoid the influence of the increased inflammation following physical injuries, an intelligent, double-layer, alginate hydrogel system is designed. This system fosters the matrix metalloproeinases (MMP) secreted by transplanted stem cell reactions with MMP peptide grafted on the inner layer and destroys the structure of the inner hydrogel layer during the inflammatory storm. Meanwhile, the optimum concentration of the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptide is also immobilized to the inner hydrogels to obtain more stem cells before arriving to the outer hydrogel layer. It is found that blocking Cripto-1, which promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation to dopamine neurons, also accelerates this process in neural stem cells. More interesting is the fact that neural stem cell differentiation can be conducted in astrocyte-differentiation medium without other treatments.

The management of chronic PSD is variable, contentious, and problematic. Although many surgical procedures have been tried, the best surgical method remains controversial. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis of literature is to provide surgeons an objective instrument of decision through an analysis of recurrence rate of various surgical techniques in a long-term follow-up.METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed to identify all available studies. According to the pre-specified protocol, all studies reporting a surgical approach to PSD with a minimum follow-up of 5 years were included.RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the analysis. The number of patients varied from 50 to 1165 with a mean follow-up from 58.36 to 240 months. The overall incidence of recurrence was of 0.138; the resulting incidence of open healing, midline closure and out-midline closure were of 17.9%, 16.8% and 10% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, our data reveal a rate of relapsing disease higher than the one defined in previous studies both for the overall PSD and for each surgical procedure. A long-term follow-up of at least 5 years, should be considered the gold standard in pilonidal sinus surgery benchmarking. From our results, we can state that open healing and midline closure should not be considered effective for their high frequency of relapse disease and midline primary closure should be preferred.",2018,Follow up Longterm Pilonidal sinus Surgery,"['Department of Surgical Specialities and Nephrology, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Via S.

Moxidectin and fenbendazole are the two current labeled drugs that target the encysted larval stages; however, there is limited knowledge of the local inflammatory response to the larvae and to the two treatments in clinically healthy horses. This study is the first to evaluate the local inflammatory response to cyathostomin larvae and to larvicidal treatment at 2 and 5 weeks post treatment. Thirty-six ponies with naturally acquired cyathostomin infections were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Group 1, fenbendazole at 10 mg/kg for 5 days, Group 2, a single dose of moxidectin at 0.4 mg/kg, and Group 3, untreated controls. Tissue samples from the cecum and dorsal and ventral colons were used for histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Tissues were stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for light microscopy and immunohistochemically for MAC387, CD20, and CD3 for differentiation of activated macrophages, B cells, and T cells, respectively. Semiquantitative scores were assigned for all inflammatory cell types and fibrous connective tissue. Larvae observed by light microscopy were enumerated and classified by stage. Mucosal ulcerations and submucosal granulomas were also enumerated. Mean macrophage scores were higher in the moxidectin group than the fenbendazole group (p = 0.0185) and the control group had a higher activated macrophage score than both treatment groups (p = 0.0104, p = 0.0004).

However, the value of US-defined TS in predicting RA development is unclear. We assessed the predictive utility of US-defined TS alongside US-defined synovitis and clinical and serological variables in a prospective cohort of early arthritis patients.METHODS: One hundred and seven patients with clinically apparent synovitis of one or more joint and symptom duration ⩽3 months underwent baseline clinical, laboratory and US assessment of 19 bilateral joint sites and 16 bilateral tendon compartments. Diagnostic outcome was determined after 18 months, applying the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA. The predictive values of US-defined TS for persistent RA were compared with those of US-defined synovitis, clinical and serological variables.RESULTS: A total of 4066 US joint sites and 3424 US tendon compartments were included in the analysis. Forty-six patients developed persistent RA, 17 patients developed non-RA persistent disease and 44 patients had resolving disease at follow-up. US-defined TS in at least one tendon compartment at baseline was common in all groups (RA 85%, non-RA persistent disease 71% and resolving 70%). On multi-variate analysis, US-defined digit flexor TS provided independent predictive data over and above the presence of ACPA and US-defined joint synovitis.CONCLUSION: US-defined digit flexor TS provided independent predictive data for persistent RA development in patients with early arthritis.

Lamin A is a key intermediate filament component of the nuclear lamina that is downregulated during granulopoiesis. When elevated, lamin A restricts nuclear squeezing through rigid confinements. To determine if the low lamin A expression by leukocyte nuclei is critical for their exceptional squeezing ability through endothelial barriers, we overexpressed this protein in granulocyte-like differentiated HL-60 cells. A 10-fold higher lamin A expression did not interfere with chemokinetic motility of these granulocytes on immobilized CXCL1. Furthermore, these lamin A high leukocytes exhibited normal chemotaxis toward CXCL1 determined in large pore transwell barriers, but poorly squeezed through 3 μm pores toward identical CXCL1 gradients. Strikingly, however, these leukocytes successfully completed paracellular TEM across inflamed endothelial monolayers under shear flow, albeit with a small delay in nuclear squeezing into their sub-endothelial pseudopodia. In contrast, CXCR2 mediated granulocyte motility through collagen I barriers was dramatically delayed by lamin A overexpression due to a failure of lamin A high nuclei to translocate into the pseudopodia of the granulocytes. Collectively, our data predict that leukocytes maintain a low lamin A content in their nuclear lamina in order to optimize squeezing through extracellular collagen barriers but can tolerate high lamin A content when crossing the highly adaptable barriers presented by the endothelial cytoskeleton.",2018,chemokines chemotaxis granulocytes inflammation motility,"['Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Faculty of Engineering, Bar Ilan Institute of Nanotechnologies and Advanced Materials, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Faculty of Engineering, Bar Ilan Institute of Nanotechnologies and Advanced Materials, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Nancy E. and Peter C.

The aim of this exploratory, retrospective study was to analyze the effect of immunotherapy on these markers to determine which agents are disease modifying.METHODS: Cross-sectional immunological observations were made in an IRB-approved case-control study, and patients were treated empirically. Ten different CSF lymphocyte subpopulations from 18 children with persistent OMS had been measured by flow cytometry before and after clinical treatment with cyclophosphamide/ACTH/IVIG combination (n = 7) or ACTH/IVIG alone (n = 11). Clinical severity of OMS was scored from videotapes by a blinded observer using the OMS Evaluation Scale.RESULTS: Only cyclophosphamide combination therapy (mean dose 26 ± 3 mg/kg or 922 ± 176 mg/m2 x 6 cycles) significantly decreased the percentage of CSF B cells. The mean reduction was 65%, with CSF B cell frequency normalized at 7-8 months in 70%. Other abnormalities of the CSF immunophenotype, such as the low CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, persisted, and there were no therapeutic changes in T cell activation/maturation markers. Effects on relative and absolute size of PBMC subsets were similar. Clinical improvement was 70% and 55% in respective treatment groups. The relapse rates of the two groups did not significantly differ.DISCUSSION: The main effect of cyclophosphamide combination therapy on neuroinflammation in OMS was moderate reduction in CSF B cell expansion.

Understanding interaction of AuNPs with immune system is essential in designing their safety and possibilities of biomedical applications. An experiment was conducted to determine immunotropic activity of gold nanocolloid (AuNPs) administered orally to chickens depending on dose and duration time. 162 birds were assigned to 9 experimental groups of 18 birds each. The control group (C) did not receive AuNPs. Groups: T10.5, T11.0, T11.5, T12.0, received nano-gold in a rate of 0.5 mg/kg body weight/d, 1.0 mg/kg body weight/d, 1.5 mg/kg body weight/d and 2.0 mg/kg body weight/d in 8-14, 22-28 and 36-42 days of the life. The birds in groups T20.5, T21.0, T21.5, T22.0, received nano-gold in the same doses, but only in 8-10, 22-24 and 36-38 days of life. Phagocytic activity of leukocytes was determined in vitro using Staphylococcus aureus 209P strain, their respiratory burst activity was quantified by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. Serum lysozyme content was determined by the turbidimetric method. The Wintrobe method was used to determine the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Ceruloplasmin in the blood plasma was estimated by the p-phenylenediamine colorimetric method. The level of chicken immunoglobulins: IgA, IgM and IgY and interleukin IL-6 in the blood were determined using ELISA tests. The lowest dose of AuNPs, independently on duration time had no effect on immune parameters of chickens. In all other groups receiving nano-gold for a shorter period (T2), there was an increase in the respiratory burst activity of leukocytes and a drop in lysozyme activity in blood. The higher doses (1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg body weight/d) of the nano-gold administered for the longer time period had a pro-inflammatory effect, as indicated by an increase in the level of interleukin 6 and ceruloplasmin activity as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. They also contributed to an elevation of class IgA and IgY contents in blood. The results of the study revealed that the influence of nano-gold on immune response of chickens were dependent both on dose and duration time.

Upon activation, pro-inflammatory mediators are produced by microglia, triggering excessive inflammatory responses and ultimately damaging dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, the identification of agents that inhibit neuroinflammation may be an effective approach for developing novel treatments for PD. In this study, we sought to investigate whether peiminine protects dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation. We evaluated the effects of peiminine on behavioural dysfunction, microglial activation and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD. BV-2 cells were pretreated with peiminine for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for different times. Then, inflammatory responses and the related signalling pathways were analysed. Peiminine markedly attenuated behavioural dysfunction and inhibited the loss of dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation in the LPS-induced PD rat model. In BV-2 cells, peiminine significantly decreased LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, COX-2 and iNOS by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT and NF-κB p65.

Our objective was to compare the oxylipin composition of VLDL, LDL, and HDL in 14 optimally healthy individuals and 31 MetSyn patients, and then to determine the effects of treating MetSyn subjects with 4g/day of prescription omega-3 fatty acids (P-OM3) on lipoprotein oxylipin profiles. We compared oxylipin compositions of healthy (14) and MetSyn (31) subjects followed by randomization and assignment to 4g/d P-OM3 for 16 weeks using LC/MS/MS. Compared to healthy subjects, MetSyn is characterized by abnormalities of (1) pro-inflammatory, arachidonate-derived oxylipins from the lipoxygenase pathway in HDL; and (2) oxylipins mostly not derived from arachidonate in VLDL.

These processes set in motion a cascade of events in host cells and tissue, which activate multiple cytokines that serve as activators of the host inflammatory response as well as eventually lead to resolution of the response if the host recovers.

Various bacteria, which are responsible for deadly diseases including tuberculosis and salmonellosis, are capable of hijacking this important immune cell type and thrive intracellularly, either in the cytoplasm or in specialized vacuoles. Tight regulation of cellular metabolism is critical in shaping the macrophage polarization states and immune functions. Lipids, besides being the bulk component of biological membranes, serve as energy sources as well as signaling molecules during infection and inflammation. With the advent of systems-scale analyses of genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, in combination with classical biology, it is increasingly evident that macrophages undergo extensive lipid remodeling during activation and infection. Each bacterium species has evolved its own tactics to manipulate host metabolism toward its own advantage. Furthermore, modulation of host lipid metabolism affects disease susceptibility and outcome of infections, highlighting the critical roles of lipids in infectious diseases. Here, we will review the emerging roles of lipids in the complex host-pathogen relationship and discuss recent methodologies employed to probe these versatile metabolites during the infection process. An improved understanding of the lipid-centric nature of infections can lead to the identification of the Achilles' heel of the pathogens and host-directed targets for therapeutic interventions.

The prebiotics and probiotics can improve the host cognition. A previous study demonstrated that fructooligosaccharides from Morinda officinalis (OMO) exert effective memory improvements in AD-like animals, thereby considered as potential prebiotics; however, the underlying mechanism still remains enigma. Thus, the present study investigated whether OMO is effective in alleviating AD by targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis. OMO was administered in rats with AD-like symptoms (D-galactose- and Aβ1-42-induced deficient rats). Significant and systematic deterioration in AD-like animals were identified, including learning and memory abilities, histological changes, production of cytokines, and microbial community shifts. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that OMO administration can ameliorate the learning and memory abilities in both AD-like animals significantly. AD parameters showed that OMO administration cannot only improve oxidative stress and inflammation disorder, but also regulate the synthesis and secretion of neurotransmitter. Histological changes indicated that OMO administration ameliorates the swelling of brain tissues, neuronal apoptosis, and down-regulation of the expression of AD intracellular markers (Tau and Aβ1-42). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota indicated that OMO administration maintains the diversity and stability of the microbial community. In addition, OMO regulated the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mice model treated by overdosed antibiotics and thus showed the prebiotic potential. Moreover, gut microbiota plays a major role in neurodevelopment, leading to alterations in gene expression in critical brain and intestinal regions, thereby resulting in perturbation to the programming of normal cognitive behaviors.

In these patients there was no association between onset of event and elevated serum NN. In 190 patients in whom events were not attributed to SLE by the SLICC rules, median serum NN was elevated at the onset of event (P = 0.006).

Then, in 20 rats, 3 h after INH or VEH followed by the test meal (parallel study), we measured the mRNA level of a set of cytokines (Il1-β, Il-6, Tnfα, Mcp-1, Pai-1), and of Tlr4 and Tlr2 in the adipose tissue and the liver, and that of adhesion molecules (Icam-1 and Vcam-1) in the aorta.RESULTS: Plasma IL-6 and PAI-1 increased >4-fold at 3-4 h after test-meals, very similarly after INH as compared to VEH. The expression of TLR2 and of all measured cytokine genes in the adipose tissue was dramatically higher after INH (vs VEH). In the liver, gene expression of Il1-β, Tnfα, Mcp-1 and Tlr2, was also higher after INH, though more moderately, whereas that of Il-6 and Pai-1 was similar between groups. INH did not affect mRNA level of Icam-1 and Vcam-1 in the aorta.CONCLUSION: TLR4 activation is not specifically required to mediate systemic postprandial inflammation and we propose that TLR2 and TLR4 exert a dual and interdependent mediation of the postprandial inflammatory response, at least in the adipose tissue.",2017,Adipose tissue Inflammation Postprandial TLR,"['UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'UMR Physiologie de la Nutrition et du Comportement Alimentaire, AgroParisTech, INRA, Université Paris-Saclay, 16 rue Claude Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Nutrition & metabolism'],['England'],"[['Hermier', 'Dominique'], ['Mathé', 'Véronique'], ['Lan', 'Annaïg'], ['Santini', 'Clélia'], ['Quignard-Boulangé', 'Annie'], ['Huneau', 'Jean-François'], ['Mariotti', 'François']]",['Journal Article'],"['Adipose', 'tissue', 'Inflammation', 'Postprandial', 'TLR']",2010s,2010-now

Host-directed immunotherapy has been reported as an attractive option to treat microbial infections. It consists in the improvement of host defenses by increasing the expression of inflammatory mediators and/or controlling of inflammation-induced tissue injury. Although the in vitro antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of lectins have been extensively demonstrated, few studies have evaluated their in vivo effects on experimental models of infections. This review aims to highlight the experimental use of immunomodulatory plant lectins to improve the host immune response against microbial infections. Lectins have been used in vivo both prophylactically and therapeutically resulting in the increased survival of mice under microbial challenge. Other studies successfully demonstrated that lectins could be used in combination with parasite antigens in order to induce a more efficient immunization.

We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia.METHODS: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients.RESULTS: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 ± 9 years, 76% male), 99 (16.3%) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p <0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI.

Nociceptor sensory neurons detect immune mediators to produce pain, and release neuropeptides that act on the immune system to regulate inflammation. In parallel, neural reflex circuits including the vagus nerve-based inflammatory reflex are physiological regulators of inflammatory responses and cytokine production. In transplantation, neuro-immune communication could significantly impact the processes of host-pathogen defense, organ rejection, and wound healing.

Warburg observed that cancer cells generated energy through glycolysis (generation of ATP through degradation of glucose, usually associated with anaerobic conditions) rather than through oxidative phosphorylation (generation of ATP through the mitochondrial inner membrane via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, usually associated with aerobic conditions). Although the initial pathways of cancer and sepsis may be different, the mechanisms which allow aerobic glycolysis to occur, even in the presence of oxygen, are similar. This review provides some evidence that reversing these steps reverses the Warburg Effect in model systems and some pathological consequences of this effect. Therefore, this implies that these steps might be modifiable in sepsis to reverse the Warburg Effect and possibly lead to better outcomes.",2018,Glycolysis Metabolism Oxidative phosphorylation Sepsis Warburg effect,"['Trauma Research Dept, Swedish Medical Center, Englewood, CO 80113, USA; Trauma Research Dept, Medical Center of Plano, Plano, TX 75075, USA; Trauma Research Dept, St. Anthony Hospital, Lakewood, CO 80228, USA; Trauma Research Dept, Penrose Hospital, Colorado Springs, CO 80907, USA.

For this, FLB loading into liposomes was optimized and liposomes were entrapped in thermosensitive hydrogels consisted of Pluronic F-127 (P). FLB solution, liposomes, and FLB dissolved in hydrogel were also used as control formulations. Actively loaded liposomes were found to be optimal for high FLB loading and small size, while in vitro studies revealed that P concentration of 18% (w/v) was best to retain the integrity of the hydrogel-dispersed liposome, compared to a 20% concentration. The in vitro release of FLB was significantly sustained when FLB-liposomes were dispersed in the hydrogel compared to hydrogel dissolved FLB, as well as the other control formulations. In vivo studies were carried out in pigmented rabbits which were injected through a 27G needle with 1mg/mL FLB in the different formulation-types. Ophthalmic examinations after intravitreal injection of all FLB formulations, revealed no evidence of inflammation, hemorrhage, uveitis or endophthalmitis. Pharmacokinetic analysis results confirm that the hybrid drug delivery system increases the bioavailability (by 1.9 times compared to solution), and extends the presence of the drug in the vitreous cavity, while liposome and hydrogel formulations demonstrate intermediate performance.

The results of this study show that treatment with metformin significantly decreased colonic mucosal damage, maintained oxidative homeostasis and normalized intestinal transit and W/L ratio in a dose-dependent manner. The restorative effect of metformin on colonic mucosa was accompanied by a marked reduction in the tissue levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and immunoreactivity of COX-2, iNOS and NFκB(p65).

Inflammation has been widely accepted as the major driving force of TIF. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway. CBS is considered to play protective role in liver and pulmonary fibrosis, but its role in TIF remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role and mechanism of CBS in renal inflammation and TIF.METHODS: Renal function, tubulointerstitium damage index score, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and the expressions of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, CD3, CD68, IL-1β, TNF-α were measured in sham operation and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rats. Proteomics and gene array analysis were performed to screen differentially expressed molecules in the development of renal inflammation and TIF in UUO rats. The expression of CBS was detected in patients with obstructive nephropathy and UUO rats. We confirmed the expression of CBS using western blot and real-time PCR in HK-2 cells. Overexpression plasmid and siRNA were transfected specifically to study the possible function of CBS in HK-2 cells.RESULTS: Abundant expression of CBS, localized in renal tubular epithelial cells, was revealed in human and rat renal tissue, which correlated negatively with the progression of fibrotic disease. Expression of CBS was dramatically decreased in the obstructed kidney from UUO rats as compared with the sham group (SHM). In addition, knocking down CBS exacerbated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, whereas CBS overexpression attenuated TGF-β1-induced ECM deposition in vitro.

In total, 1,051 chemotherapy sessions were administered. Twenty-three patients experienced perianal abscess. Patients with perianal abscess were younger than those without (44 vs. 60 years, p < 0.0001). Perianal abscess developed in various phases of treatment and in the stem cell transplantation period. Twelve recurrences developed in 6 patients. Patients with a prior perianal abscess have a 10-fold risk of developing a subsequent abscess following further chemotherapy. The microbiology profile revealed that most pathogens were derived from the intestinal tracts, which was similar to the findings of previous studies. The 28-day mortality was 14.3% and the direct cause of death was not perianal abscess in any case. Surgical interventions had no impact on recurrence or survival.CONCLUSION: In patients with AML, perianal abscess results from gastrointestinal tract pathogens. Many patients do not require surgical interventions. The mortality is low but recurrence is common following subsequent chemotherapies.

Using immortalized human myometrial (hTERT-HM) cells stably expressing wild-type PR-A or PR-B (PRWT), we found that P4 significantly inhibited IL-1β induction of the NF-κB target genes, COX-2 and IL-8 P4-PRWT transrepression occurred at the level of transcription initiation and was mediated by decreased recruitment of NF-κB p65 and RNA polymerase II to COX-2 and IL-8 promoters. However, in cells stably expressing a PR-A or PR-B DNA-binding domain mutant (PRmDBD), P4-mediated transrepression was significantly reduced, suggesting a critical role of the PR DBD. ChIP analysis of hTERT-HM cells stably expressing PRWT or PRmDBD revealed that P4 treatment caused equivalent recruitment of PRWT and PRmDBD to COX-2 and IL-8 promoters, suggesting that PR inhibitory effects were not mediated by its direct DNA binding. Using immunoprecipitation, followed by MS, we identified a transcriptional repressor, GATA zinc finger domain-containing 2B (GATAD2B), that interacted strongly with PRWT but poorly with PRmDBD P4 treatment of PRWT hTERT-HM cells caused enhanced recruitment of endogenous GATAD2B to COX-2 and IL-8 promoters. Further, siRNA knockdown of endogenous GATAD2B significantly reduced P4-PRWT transrepression of COX-2 and IL-8 Notably, GATAD2B expression was significantly decreased in pregnant mouse and human myometrium during labor. Our findings suggest that GATAD2B serves as an important mediator of P4-PR suppression of proinflammatory and contractile genes during pregnancy.

The mechanisms that drive the sustained effects by oxidized PAPC (OxPAPC) remain unexplored. On the basis of the structural similarity of isoprostanoid moieties that are present in full-length oxygenated PAPC species, we used an inhibitory approach to perform the screening of prostanoid receptors as potential candidates that mediate OxPAPC effects. Results show that only prostaglandin E receptor-4 (EP4) was involved and mediated the sustained phase of the barrier-enhancing effects of OxPAPC that are associated with the activation of Rac GTPase and its cytoskeletal targets. EC incubation with OxPAPC also induced EP4 mRNA expression in pulmonary ECs and lung tissue. EP4 knockdown using gene-specific small interfering RNA did not affect the rapid phase of OxPAPC-induced EC barrier enhancement or the protective effects against thrombin-induced EC permeability, but abolished the advanced barrier enhancement phase and suppressed the protective effects of OxPAPC against more sustained EC barrier dysfunction and cell inflammatory response caused by TNF-α. Endothelial-specific knockout of the EP4 receptor in mice attenuated the protective effect of intravenous OxPAPC administration in the model of acute lung injury caused by intratracheal injection of LPS.

Here we show that Fetuin-A (FetA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exacerbate palmitic acid-induced podocyte death, which is associated with a strong induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC). Moreover, blockage of TLR4 prevents MCP-1 and KC secretion and attenuates podocyte death induced by palmitic acid alone or combined with FetA. In addition, inhibition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling by anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1Ra, or a murinized anti-IL-1β antibody attenuates the inflammatory and ultimate cell death response elicited by FetA alone or combined with palmitic acid. In vivo short-term therapy of diabetic DBA/2J mice with an anti-IL1-β antibody for 4 weeks prevented an increase in serum FetA and considerably decreased urinary tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α), a known risk factor for DN progression. In summary, our results suggest that FetA similarly to LPS leads to an inflammatory response in podocytes, which exacerbates palmitic acid-induced podocyte death and our data imply a critical role for IL-1β signaling in this process.

In particular, a novel subset of IgM+ CD21/35lo/- CD23- mature B cells, the age-associated B cells or ABC, increases numerically and proportionately. This occurs at the expense of other B cell subsets, including B2 follicular B cells in spleen and recirculating primary B cells in bone marrow. Our studies suggest that ABC have a distinctive antibody repertoire, as evidenced by relatively high reactivity to the self-antigens phosphorylcholine (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). While PC and MDA are found on apoptotic cells and oxidized lipoproteins, antibodies to these antigens are also cross-reactive with epitopes on bacterial species. In old mice, ABC express TNFα and are pro-inflammatory. ABC can inhibit growth and/or survival in pro-B cells as well as common lymphoid progenitors (CLP). In particular, ABC cause apoptosis in pro-B cells with relatively high levels of the surrogate light chain (SLC) and, consequently, promote an ""SLC low"" pathway of B cell differentiation in old mice. SLC together with μ heavy chain comprises the pre-B cell receptor (preBCR) critical for pre-B cell expansion and selection of the μ heavy chain Vh repertoire. The low level of SLC likely impairs normal preBCR driven proliferation and alters μ heavy chain Vh selection thereby affecting the antibody specificities of new B cells.

Diabetes severity was categorized based on International Classification of Diseases codes and the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of SAB associated with diabetes was estimated by conditional logistic regression analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) were analyzed by Cox proportional regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, hospital contact and diabetes duration.RESULTS: Of 25,855 SAB cases, 2797 (10.8%) had diabetes and 2913 (11.3%) had diabetes with complications compared to 14,189 (5.5%) and 5499 (2.1%) of 258,547 controls.

Sinonasal mucosal specimens were obtained from the frontal recess, ethmoid sinus, and nasal polyp separately.RESULTS: The expression of IL-5 was significantly elevated in all sinonasal regions tested in the ECRS group, but absent in non-ECRS patients. Furthermore, the ECRS patients showed significantly increased levels of IL-5 in the frontal recess mucosa compared with ethmoid sinus mucosa. IL-6 was also significantly increased in the frontal recess mucosa compared with ethmoid sinus mucosa and nasal polyps in these patients. There were no significant differences in the levels of TGF-β or iNOS between the ECRS and non-ECRS groups in any sinonasal region tested.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to characterize the cytokine milieu in the frontal recess of ECRS patients.

The genetic variations in these two genes (IL-6: rs6949149, rs1800796, rs10499563 and IL-6R: rs2228145) have been suggested to be associated with gastric cancer risk. However, the published results were inconsistent among subjects of different ethnicity. To evaluate such an association in Chinese population, we carried out this case-control study based on 473 patients with gastric cancer and 474 healthy controls, whose genotypes were detected by the Sequenom MassARRAY platform, and Helicobacter pylori infection was assessed by immunogold testing kit. This study showed that rs1800796 CG genotype was associated with decreased risk of gastric cancer (adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.57-0.99, p=0.043).

Hypothermia treatment (HT) does not provide neuroprotection after pre-insult inflammatory sensitisation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a gram-negative bacterial wall constituent. However, early-onset sepsis in term babies is caused by gram-positive species in more than 90% of cases, and neuro-inflammatory responses triggered through the gram-negative route (Toll-like receptor 4, TLR-4) are different from those induced through the gram-positive route via TLR-2. Whether gram-positive septicaemia sensitises the neonatal brain to hypoxia and inhibits the neuroprotective effect of HT is unknown. Seven-day-old Wistar rats (n = 178) were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of PAM3CSK4 (1 mg/kg, a synthetic TLR-2 agonist) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl). After an 8-h delay, the left carotid artery was ligated followed by 50 min of hypoxia (8% O2) at a rectal temperature of 36°C. Pups received a 5-h treatment of normothermia (NT, 37°C) or HT (32°C) immediately after the insult. Brains were harvested after 7 days' survival for hemispheric and hippocampal area loss analyses and immunolabelling of microglia (Iba1) and hippocampal neurons (NeuN). Normothermic PAM3CSK4-injected animals showed significantly more brain injury than vehicle animals (p = 0.014). Compared to NT, HT significantly reduced injury in the PAM3CSK4-injected animals, with reduced area loss (p < 0.001), reduced microglial activation (p = 0.006), and increased neuronal rescue in the CA1 region (p < 0.001). Experimental induction of a sepsis-like condition through the gram-positive pathway sensitises the brain to HI injury. HT was highly neuroprotective after the PAM3CSK4-triggered injury, suggesting HT may be neuroprotective in the presence of a gram-positive infection.

The potential role of estradiol as a contributing factor to a sex difference in macrophage function with age was also examined. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages derived from the young (2 months old) and the naturally senescent intact middle-aged (16 months old) male and female rats were tested for cytokine secretion and antimicrobial activity (NO and H2O2 production and myeloperoxidase activity). Serum concentration of estradiol and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ on freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages were also examined. Decreased secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 by macrophages from middle-aged compared to the young females was accompanied with the lesser density of macrophage ERα expression and the lower systemic level of estradiol, whereas the opposite was true for middle-aged male rats.

We aimed to uncover the exact roles of miR-9 and downstream signaling pathways using in vitro human atherosclerosis models.METHODS: We used oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated human THP-1 derived macrophages, oxLDL-stimulated human primary peripheral blood monocytes and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or Alum-stimulated human THP-1 derived macrophages as in vitro atherosclerosis inflammation models. Transient transfection of over-expression vectors, small interference RNAs (siRNAs) or antisense oligonucleotides was used to regulate intracellular protein or miR-9 levels. Cell responses and signal transduction were detected by multiple assays including Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and luciferase reporter assay.RESULTS: MiR-9 inhibited while anti-miR-9 antisense oligonucleotides induced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in all in vitro models. Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) were identified as the target genes of miR-9. In oxLDL-stimulated human THP-1 derived macrophages, knockdown of JAK1 by siRNA blocked the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and mimicked the effects of miR-9. In the same model, JAK1 knockdown blocked the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in the nuclei and the phosphorylation of NF-κB IκBα in the cytoplasm.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that miR-9 could inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and attenuate atherosclerosis-related inflammation, likely through the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium that causes septic arthritis. Severity of this disease is directly correlated with chronic inflammation induced by proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP-2. The objective of our study was to evaluate the role of MMP-2 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infection-induced septic arthritis. Mice were infected with live S. aureus (5 × 106 cells/ml) followed by administration of MMP-2 inhibitor and TNFR1 antibody. Arthritis index showed highest reduction in severity of arthritis in mice treated with both MMP-2 inhibitor and TNFR1 antibody after infection. Combined neutralization of MMP-2 and TNFR1 led to marked diminution in bacterial count in the combined group. Lowest levels of pro inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ were observed in both serum and synovial tissues indicating maximum protection in S. aureus arthritis during combination treatment. Increment in the level of IL-10 in the combination group could be positively correlated with the recovery of arthritis. Similarly, expressions of COX-2 and iNOS, markers of acute inflammation were also significantly reduced in the combination group due to resolution of inflammation. Levels of O2.- and NO also showed a significant fall in case of the group treated with MMP-2 inhibitor and TNFR1 antibody both. Neutralization of both MMP-2 and TNFR1 caused rapid decline in recruitment of neutrophil and macrophages in the synovial tissues as evident from reduced MPO and MCP-1 levels, respectively, compared to other groups.

We calculated odds ratios with 99% confidence intervals for having each disorder comparing children with concentration in the top quartile of each protein to children whose concentration was in the lower quartiles on the corresponding day. Analyses were adjusted for gestational age and birth weight Z-score.RESULTS: Only one of 80 assessments (16 proteins on five different days) was significant for visual field deficit, and one for impaired fixation.

The relative contribution of DA receptors and astrocytic glutamate transporter (GLT-1) in cognitive functions is largely unexplored. Similarly, whether microglia-derived increased immune response affects cognitive functions and neuronal survival is not yet understood. We have investigated the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) on cognitive functions and its possible underlying mechanism of action in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced hemiparkinsonian rats. ALCAR treatment in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats improved memory functions as confirmed by decreased latency time and path length in the Morris water maze test. ALCAR further enhanced D1 receptor levels without altering D2 receptor levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions, suggesting that the D1 receptor is preferentially involved in the regulation of cognitive functions. ALCAR attenuated microglial activation and release of inflammatory mediators through balancing proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently enhanced the survival of mature neurons in the CA1, CA3, and PFC regions and improved cognitive functions in hemiparkinsonian rats. ALCAR treatment also improved glutathione (GSH) content, while decreasing oxidative stress indices, inducible nitrogen oxide synthase (iNOS) levels, and astrogliosis resulting in the upregulation of GLT-1 levels. Additionally, ALCAR prevented the loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in ventral tagmental area (VTA)/substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) regions of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, thus maintaining the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway. Together, these results demonstrate that ALCAR treatment in hemiparkinsonian rats ameliorates neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits, hence suggesting its therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases.",2018,AcetylLcarnitine Dopamine receptor Glutamate transporter1 Mesocorticolimbic pathway Microglial activation Neuronal survival,"['Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), BS-10/1, Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), BS-10/1, Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), BS-10/1, Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), BS-10/1, Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), BS-10/1, Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India. shubha_shukla@cdri.res.in.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi, India. shubha_shukla@cdri.res.in.']",['eng'],['Molecular neurobiology'],"['International', 'United States']","[['Singh', 'Sonu'], ['Mishra', 'Akanksha'], ['Srivastava', 'Neha'], ['Shukla', 'Rakesh'], ['Shukla', 'Shubha']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['AcetylLcarnitine', 'Dopamine', 'receptor', 'Glutamate', 'transporter', 'Mesocorticolimbic', 'pathway', 'Microglial', 'activation', 'Neuronal', 'survival']",2010s,2010-now

We initially studied 74 stable COPD patients and 18 controls. For internal validation, we additionally studied 160 COPD patients of a former visit.RESULTS: ANGPTL4 was significantly elevated in COPD patients compared with controls (p=0.026). After correction for traditional CVD risk factors, including hs-CRP, higher levels of ANGPTL4 were independently associated with lower ABI (p=0.023) and higher NT-proBNP (p<0.001).

Symptoms of pancreatitis may be masked by abdominal pain in pediatric IBD. During the initial presentation of IBD in our patient, lipase was elevated to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal. Normalization of values coincided with remission of IBD. This may be due to extraintestinal involvement of the pancreas as part of the inflammatory process or due to leakage of pancreatic enzymes from an inflamed gut or mediated by inflammatory cytokines. Checking pancreatic enzymes during initial presentation of IBD may, therefore, be important to determine if pancreatic involvement has resulted from the inflammation in IBD or as an adverse effect of therapy. If unchecked, recurrent subclinical pancreatitis may be masked by IBD symptoms and missed prior to starting IBD therapy. This may result in chronic pancreatic insufficiency as reported in 50% of adults with IBD. Early detection of elevated pancreatic enzymes in IBD may help direct the management strategy, as treatment of the underlying inflammation in IBD may be the most important management for resolution of pancreatitis instead of cessation of therapy for fear of iatrogenic medication-induced pancreatitis.",2016,Inflammatory bowel disease Lipase Pancreatitis Pediatric patient,"['University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Tex., USA.', 'University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Tex., USA.']",['eng'],['Case reports in gastroenterology'],['Switzerland'],"[['Ray', 'Piyali'], ['Van Arsdall', 'Melissa R']]",['Case Reports'],"['Inflammatory', 'bowel', 'disease', 'Lipase', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pediatric', 'patient']",2010s,2010-now

Though PD is multifactorial, several epidemiological reports show an increased incidence of PD with co-exposure to pesticides such as Maneb and paraquat (MP). In pesticide-related PD, mitochondrial dysfunction and α-synuclein oligomers have been strongly implicated, but the link between the two has not yet been understood. Similarly, the biological effects of α-synuclein or its radical chemistry in PD is largely unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction during PD pathogenesis leads to release of cytochrome c in the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c has one of two fates: It either binds to apaf1 and initiates apoptosis or can act as a peroxidase. We hypothesized that as a peroxidase, cytochrome c leaked out from mitochondria can form radicals on α-synuclein and initiate its oligomerization.METHOD: Samples from controls, and MP co-exposed wild-type and α-synuclein knockout mice were studied using immuno-spin trapping, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and microarray experiments.RESULTS: Experiments with MP co-exposed mice showed cytochrome c release in cytosol and its co-localization with α-synuclein. Subsequently, we used immuno-spin trapping method to detect the formation of α-synuclein radical in samples from an in vitro reaction mixture consisting of cytochrome c, α-synuclein, and hydrogen peroxide. These experiments indicated that cytochrome c plays a role in α-synuclein radical formation and oligomerization. Experiments with MP co-exposed α-synuclein knockout mice, in which cytochrome c-α synuclein co-localization and interaction cannot occur, mice showed diminished protein radical formation and neuronal death, compared to wild-type MP co-exposed mice. Microarray data from MP co-exposed wild-type and α-synuclein knockout mice further showed that the absence of α-synuclein per se or its co-localization with cytochrome c confers protection from MP co-exposure, as several important pathways were unaffected in α-synuclein knockout mice.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results show that peroxidase activity of cytochrome c contributes to α-synuclein radical formation and oligomerization, and that α-synuclein, through its co-localization with cytochrome c or on its own, affects several biological pathways which contribute to increased neuronal death in an MP-induced model of PD.",2016,Cytochrome c Immunospin trapping Parkinsons disease Peroxidase αsynuclein radical,"['Free Radical Biology Group, Immunity, Inflammation, and Disease Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, 111 T.W.

In the present study, we have developed a fully integrated electrochemical biosensor platform for cytokine detection at minute concentrations. Using eight gold working microelectrodes (WEs) the design will increase the sensitivity of detection, decrease the time of measurements, and allow a simultaneous detection of varying cytokine biomarkers. The biosensor platform was fabricated onto silicon substrates using silicon technology. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) of anti-human IL-1b and anti-human IL-10 were electroaddressed onto the gold WEs through functionalization with 4-carboxymethyl aryl diazonium (CMA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied during the WE functionalization process to characterize the gold WE surface properties. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterized the modified gold WE. The biosensor platform was highly sensitive to the corresponding cytokines and no interference with other cytokines was observed. Both cytokines: IL-10 and IL-1b were detected within the range of 1pgmL-1 to 15pgmL-1. The present electrochemical biosensor platform is very promising for multi-detection of biomolecules which can dramatically decrease the time of analysis.

We aimed to estimate the independent and relative contributions to adult CB from other potential influences spanning childhood to middle age.METHODS: The population-based Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study cohort, people born in 1961, completed respiratory questionnaires and spirometry in 1968 (n=8,583). Thirty-seven years later, in 2004, two-thirds responded to a detailed postal survey (n=5,729), from which the presence of CB was established in middle age. A subsample (n=1,389) underwent postbronchodilator spirometry between 2006 and 2008 for the assessment of chronic airflow limitation, from which nonobstructive and obstructive CB were defined. Multivariable and multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate relevant associations.RESULTS: The prevalence of CB in middle age was 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.5, 6.8). Current asthma and/or wheezy breathing in middle age was independently associated with adult CB (odds ratio [OR]: 6.2 [95% CI: 4.6, 8.4]), and this estimate was significantly higher than for current smokers of at least 20 pack-years (OR: 3.0 [95% CI: 2.1, 4.3]). Current asthma and smoking in middle age were similarly associated with obstructive CB, in contrast to the association between allergy and nonobstructive CB. Childhood predictors included allergic history (OR: 1.3 [95% CI: 1.1, 1.7]), current asthma (OR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3, 2.7]), ""episodic"" childhood asthma (OR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.4, 3.9]), and parental bronchitis symptoms (OR: 2.5 [95% CI: 1.6, 4.1]).CONCLUSION: The strong independent association between current asthma and CB in middle age suggests that this condition may be even more influential than personal smoking in a general population.

Moreover, accumulated data indicated that fat dietary factor might promote the change of the composition and metabolism in commensal flora. But, the exact mechanisms for fatty diet in gut inflammation are not well demonstrated. In this study, we found that high fat diet (HFD) promoted inflammation and exacerbated the disease severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in mice. Compared with low fat diet (LFD)/DSS mice, shorter colon length, more epithelial loss and crypt destruction and more Gr-1+ myeloid inflammatory cells infiltration in colons were observed in HFD/DSS cohorts. Interestingly, such HFD mediated inflammation accompanied with the dys-regulation of hematopoiesis, and more hematopoiesis stem and progenitor cells were detected in colon and spleen. We further analyzed the effects of HFD and DSS treatment on mucosal DC subsets, and found that DSS treatment in LFD mice mainly dramatically increased the percentage of CD11c+CD103-CD11b+ DCs in lamina propria (LP). While, in HFD/DSS mice, HFD pre-treatment not only increased the percentage of CD11c+CD103-CD11b+ DCs, but also decreased CD11c+CD103+CD11b+ in both LP and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) in mice with colitis. This disequilibrium of mucosal dendritic cells in HFD/DSS mice may depend on the reduced levels of buytrate and retinoic acid.

Myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous cell population that plays a crucial regulatory effect in immune-related diseases. However, whether mTOR signaling affects the functions of MDSCs remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that mTOR signaling is a pivotal, negative determinant of MDSC function in immune-mediated hepatic injury (IMH) diseases. In the context of IMH, the blocking of mTOR with rapamycin or mTOR-deficient CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs mediates the protection against IMH; mTOR with rapamycin and mTOR-deficient CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs are suppressive immune modulators that result in less IFN-γ-producing TH1 cells and more Foxp3+ Tregs Mechanistically, mTOR activity down-regulation in MDSCs induced iNOS expressions and NO productions. Pharmacologic inhibitions of iNOS completely eliminate MDSC-suppressive function and lose their inducible effects on T cell differentiation. Importantly, HIF1α-dependent glycolytic activity is responsible for mTOR-deficient, increased MDSC functional changes in IMH inflammation. Thus, these data demonstrate that mTOR acts as a fundamental ""rheostat"" in MDSCs to link immunologic signals to glycolytic pathways and functional fitness and highlights a central role of metabolic programming of MDSC-suppressive activity in protecting against immune hepatic injuries.",2016,T cell differentiation TH1 cells Tregs hepatitis innate immunity,"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Fudan University, Shanghai China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Fudan University, Shanghai China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing China.', 'Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department of General Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Fudan University, Shanghai China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Fudan University, Shanghai China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.', 'Medical Research Center, Department of Radiation Oncology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China lixiangxue@bjmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Fudan University, Shanghai China; huiyang@fudan.edu.cn.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Fudan University, Shanghai China; liugw@bnu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Regulation Biology of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing China.']",['eng'],['Journal of leukocyte biology'],['United States'],"[['Chen', 'Xi'], ['Zhang', 'Zhengguo'], ['Bi', 'Yujing'], ['Fu', 'Zan'], ['Gong', 'Pingsheng'], ['Li', 'Yan'], ['Yu', 'Qing'], ['Jia', 'Anna'], ['Wang', 'Jian'], ['Xue', 'Lixiang'], ['Yang', 'Hui'], ['Liu', 'Guangwei']]","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","['T', 'cell', 'differentiation', 'TH', 'cells', 'Tregs', 'hepatitis', 'innate', 'immunity']",2010s,2010-now

ANCAs against proteinase 3 (PR3) (PR3-ANCA) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) (MPO-ANCA) are found in over 90% of patients with active disease, and these ANCAs are implicated in the pathogenesis of AAV. Dying neutrophils surrounding the walls of small vessels are a histological hallmark of AAV. Traditionally, it has been assumed that these neutrophils die by necrosis, but neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been visualized at the sites of vasculitic lesions. AAV patients also possess elevated levels of NETs in the circulation. ANCAs are capable of inducing NETosis in neutrophils, and their potential to do so has been shown to be affinity dependent and to correlate with disease activity. Neutrophils from AAV patients are also more prone to release NETs spontaneously than neutrophils from healthy blood donors. NETs contain proinflammatory proteins and are thought to contribute to vessel inflammation directly by damaging endothelial cells and by activating the complement system and indirectly by acting as a link between the innate and adaptive immune system through the generation of PR3- and MPO-ANCA. Injection of NET-loaded myeloid dendritic cells into mice results in circulating PR3- and MPO-ANCA and the development of AAV-like disease. NETs have also been shown to be essential in a rodent model of drug-induced vasculitis. NETs induced by propylthiouracil could not be degraded by DNaseI, implying that disordered NETs might be important for the generation of ANCAs. NET degradation was also highlighted in another study showing that AAV patients have reduced DNaseI activity resulting in less NET degradation. With this in mind, it might be that prolonged exposure to proteins in the NETs due to the overproduction of NETs and/or reduced clearance of NETs is important in AAV. However, not all ANCAs are pathogenic and some might possibly also aid in the clearance of NETs. A dual role for ANCAs in relation to circulating NET levels has been proposed because a negative correlation was observed between PR3-ANCA and NET remnants in patients in remission.

The sympathetic nervous system is known to regulate immune system function through β-adrenergic receptors (βARs); however, their role in regulating immune cell responses to acute cardiac injury is unknown.METHODS: Wild-type (WT) mice were irradiated followed by isoform-specific βAR knockout (βARKO) or WT bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) and after full reconstitution underwent MI surgery. Survival was monitored over time, and alterations in immune cell infiltration after MI were examined through immunohistochemistry. Alterations in splenic function were identified through the investigation of altered adhesion receptor expression.RESULTS: β2ARKO BMT mice displayed 100% mortality resulting from cardiac rupture within 12 days after MI compared with ≈20% mortality in WT BMT mice. β2ARKO BMT mice displayed severely reduced post-MI cardiac infiltration of leukocytes with reciprocally enhanced splenic retention of the same immune cell populations. Splenic retention of the leukocytes was associated with an increase in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, which itself was regulated via β-arrestin-dependent β2AR signaling. Furthermore, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in both mouse and human macrophages was sensitive to β2AR activity, and spleens from human tissue donors treated with β-blocker showed enhanced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. The impairments in splenic retention and cardiac infiltration of leukocytes after MI were restored to WT levels via lentiviral-mediated re-expression of β2AR in β2ARKO bone marrow before transplantation, which also resulted in post-MI survival rates comparable to those in WT BMT mice.CONCLUSIONS: Immune cell-expressed β2AR plays an essential role in regulating the early inflammatory repair response to acute myocardial injury by facilitating cardiac leukocyte infiltration.",2016,immune system inflammation leukocytes myocardial infarction,"['From Center for Translational Medicine (L.A.G., A.M.G., C.J.T., J.E.G., A.A.R., E.G., R.L.C., J.E.R., W.J.K., D.G.T.), Department of Pharmacology (E.G., J.E.R., W.J.K., D.G.T.), and Department of Clinical Sciences (D.Y.), Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA;

However, the simple assemblage of nutraceuticals with potentially additive mechanism of action need to be clinically tested.METHODS: To assess the effects of a combination of nutraceuticals based on artichoke, red yeast rice, banaba, and coenzyme Q10, we performed a double bind, cross-over designed trial versus placebo in 30 adults with LDL cholesterol suboptimal in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. After a period of 3 weeks of dietary habits correction, patients began a period of 6 weeks of treatment with nutraceutical or placebo, followed by 2 weeks of washout and finally 6 weeks in cross-over. Data related to lipid pattern, insulin resistance, renal function, liver and CPK have been obtained at each visit.RESULTS: In particular, the after the nutraceutical treatment the enrolled patients experienced a significant improvement in total cholesterol (-13.6 %), LDL-C (-18.2 %), non-HDL-C (-15 %), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (-10 %), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (-30.9 %), and hs-CRP (-18.2 %) versus placebo. No changes have been observed in the other investigated parameters in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The tested combination of nutraceuticals has shown clinical efficacy in the reduction of total cholesterol, non-HDL, LDL and triglycerides, while improving the level of liver transaminases and high sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Knocking down of RBQ3 resulted in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and increased myeloma cells adherent to fibronectin or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Furthermore, silencing of RBQ3 reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in myeloma cell lines adherent to BMSCs and reduced two apoptotic marker proteins cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP expression.

Each group was sampled at 4, 6 and 8 wk. Liver cirrhosis was induced by injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), intragastric administration of 10% ethanol, and feeding a high fat diet. Rats in the MA group were intragastrically administered with AS (25 mg/kg body weight, once daily). Injuries of the liver and intestinal mucosa were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin or Masson's trichrome staining. Liver index was calculated as a ratio of the organ weight (g) to body weight (g). The gut microbiota was examined by automated ribosomal intergenic-spacer analysis of fecal DNA. BT was assessed by standard microbiological techniques in the blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), liver, spleen, and kidney.RESULTS: Compared to group N, the body weight was reduced significantly in groups M and MA due to the development of liver cirrhosis over the period of 8 wk. The body weight was higher in group MA than in group M. The liver indices were significantly elevated at 4, 6 and 8 wk in groups M and MA compared to group N. AS supplementation partially decreased the liver indices in group MA. Marked histopathologic changes in the liver and small intestinal mucosa in group M were observed, which were alleviated in group MA. Levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α were significantly elevated at 8 wk in ileal homogenates in group M compared to group N, which were decreased after AS supplementation in group MA. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota indicated by the mean diversity (Shannon index) and mean similarity (Sorenson index) was severe as the liver cirrhosis developed, and AS supplementation had an apparent intervention effect on the dysbiosis of gut microbiota at 4 wk. The occurrence of BT was increased in the liver of group M compared to that of group N. AS supplementation reduced BT in group MA at 8 wk. BT also occurred in the MLNs, spleen, and kidney, which was reduced by AS supplementation. BT was not detected in the blood in any group.CONCLUSION: Dysbiosis of gut microbiota, injury of intestinal mucosal barrier and BT occurred as liver cirrhosis progressed, which might enhance inflammation and aggravate liver injury.

These preclinical RA phases consist of genetic risk, local inflammation, presence of RA-related autoantibodies, asymptomatic systemic inflammation, and early non-specific symptoms prior to clinical seropositive RA. Epidemiologic studies have been important in forming hypotheses related to the biology occurring in preclinical RA. Specifically, studies associating cigarette smoking with overall RA risk as well as transitions between phases of preclinical RA were vital in helping to establish the lung as a potential important initiating site in the pathogenesis of seropositive RA.

Objective The current study explores scientific validation for this traditional medication. Materials and methods We used ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazil (DPPH) assays to estimate antioxidant activity of P. guajava leaf extracts (methanol, hexane and chloroform). Antitumour and in vivo cytotoxic activities were determined using potato disc assay (PDA) and brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. Three human carcinoma cell lines (KBM5, SCC4 and U266) were incubated with different doses (10-100 μg/mL) of extracts and the anticancer activity was estimated by MTT assay. NF-κB suppressing activity was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Chemical composition of the three extracts was identified by GC-MS. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were measured by colorimetric assays. Results and discussions The order of antioxidant activity of three extracts was methanol > chloroform > hexane. The IC50 values ranged from 22.73 to 51.65 μg/mL for KBM5; 22.82 to 70.25 μg/mL for SCC4 and 20.97 to 89.55 μg/mL for U266 cells. The hexane extract exhibited potent antitumour (IC50  value = 65.02 μg/mL) and cytotoxic (LC50  value = 32.18 μg/mL) activities.

Glycolipids are activators of different immune cell subsets the resulting inflammation is responsible for organ damage. Pulmonary involvement leads to airway inflammation; however, data on severity, as well as the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on lung function parameters and changes in peripheral immune cell subsets on lung involvement are sparse.METHODS: Seven Fabry patients and four carriers underwent detailed clinical examinations screening for pulmonary manifestations. Repetitive measurements were performed on five patients on ERT (average follow-up 5 years). Patients with Fabry disease and control volunteers were included into peripheral blood cell measurements.RESULTS: Lung involvement was present in all patients. Symptoms suggestive for lung disease were mild, however, obstructive ventilatory disorder, dominantly affecting small airways accompanied by hyperinflation was demonstrated in all affected patients. ERT resulted in small improvement of FEV1 in most treated patients. Decreased ratio of myeloid DC, Th17 cells while increase in T helper (Th)1 cells, and no change in Th2 and regulatory T (Treg) cells were detected in Fabry patients.CONCLUSIONS: Fabry disease results mainly in mild symptoms related to lung involvement, characterized by moderate non-reversible obstructive ventilatory disorder.

The neuroprotective effects of topiramate (TPM) have been reported but its putative mechanism remains unclear. The current study evaluates the role of various doses of TPM on protection of rat hippocampal cells from MPH-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in vivo. Seventy adult male rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 received normal saline (0.7 mL/rat) and group 2 was injected with MPH (10 mg/kg) for 21 days. Groups 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 concurrently were treated by MPH (10 mg/kg) and TPM (10, 30, 50, 70 and 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), respectively for 21 days. After drug administration, the open field test (OFT) was used to investigate motor activity. Oxidative, antioxidant and inflammatory factors were measured in isolated hippocampus. Also, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Cresyl violet staining of Dentate Gyrus (DG) and CA1 cell layers of the hippocampus were also performed. MPH significantly disturbs motor activity in OFT and TPM (70 and 100 mg/kg) decreased this disturbance. Also MPH significantly increased lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial reduced state of glutathione (GSH) level, interleukin (IL)-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and BDNF level in isolated hippocampal cells. Also superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity significantly decreased. Various doses of TPM attenuated these effects and significantly decreased MPH-induced oxidative damage, inflammation and hippocampal cell loss and increased BDNF level.

When disease is present, the barrier between the pulmonary circulation and the airway epithelium is damaged, allowing serum proteins to enter the airways. We identified that human glycated albumin (GA) is a molecule in human serum that triggers an inflammatory response in human airway epithelial cultures. We observed that single-donor human serum induced IL-8 secretion from primary human airway epithelial cells and from a cystic fibrosis airway cell line (CF1-16) in a dose-dependent manner. IL-8 secretion from airway epithelial cells was time dependent and rapidly increased in the first 4 h of incubation. Stimulation with GA promoted epithelial cells to secrete IL-8, and this increase was blocked by the anti-GA antibody. The IL-8 secretion induced by serum GA was 10-50-fold more potent than TNFα or LPS stimulation. GA also has a functional effect on airway epithelial cells in vitro, increasing ciliary beat frequency. Our results demonstrate that the serum molecule GA is pro-inflammatory and triggers host defense responses including increases in IL-8 secretion and ciliary beat frequency in the human airway epithelium. Although the binding site of GA has not yet been described, it is possible that GA could bind to the receptor for advanced glycated end products (RAGE), known to be expressed in the airway epithelium; however, further experiments are needed to identify the mechanism involved.

Mice were sensitized with OVA and gavaged with 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg GPS. Administration of GPS decreased lung wet-to-dry weight ratio. Histological analysis of H&E and PAS staining showed that GPS treatment alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia in lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice. Moreover, GPS inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells including total cells, macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils and the secretion of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of OVA-sensitized mice in a dose dependent manner. The levels of OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were also attenuated by GPS treatment. Interestingly, GPS upregulated the expression of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) while downregulated the expression of acetyl-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice. Furthermore, treatment with an SIRT1 inhibitor (EX-527) partially abolished the inhibitory effect of GPS on OVA-induced airway inflammation, suggesting that the anti-inflammation of GPS might be achieved through regulating SIRT1/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway.

Phillygenin (PHI), a lignin component isolated from Forsythiae Fructus, has shown a good anti-inflammatory effect. However, the mechanisms of PHI on anti-inflammation have not yet been systematically elucidated. In this study, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced RAW264.7 cell inflammation model was established to investigate mechanisms of PHI on inflammation. The effect of PHI on the release of IL-1β and PGE2 inflammatory factors induced by LPS was detected by ELISA, and the mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were detected by RT-qPCR. Proteomics studied the signaling pathways that might be affected by PHI and molecular docking technology was subsequently used to study the possible targets on proteomic screened pathways. Western blot was performed ultimately to detect progressive changes in protein expression on the related pathway. Our research showed that PHI significantly inhibited the robust increase of IL-1β and PGE2 and lowered the transcriptional level of inflammatory genes including IL-6, IL-1β and PGE2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Proteomics results indicated that PHI was involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. Molecular docking results indicated that PHI had an affinity for most proteins in NF-κB pathway. Western blot analysis proved that PHI inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB pathway activation.

As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe).RESULTS: The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that, the parameters those enhanced from complete blood count, which is a simple laboratory test, can help to identify and classify COVID-19 patients into non-severe to severe groups.",2021,COVID19 Ddimerfibrinogen ratio SARSCOV2 hematological markers neutrophillymphocyte ratio predictive value systemic immuneinflammation index,[],['eng'],['Turkish journal of medical sciences'],['Turkey'],"[['Şan', 'İshak'], ['GemcİoĞlu', 'Emİn'], ['DavutoĞlu', 'Mehmet'], ['ÇatalbaŞ', 'Ramİs'], ['KarabuĞa', 'Berkan'], ['Kaptan', 'Enes'], ['Erden', 'Abdulsamet'], ['KÜÇÜkŞahİn', 'Orhan'], ['AteŞ', 'İhsan'], ['KaraahmetoĞlu', 'Selma'], ['HasanoĞlu', 'İmran'], ['İnan', 'Osman'], ['Ünal', 'BÜŞra Nur'], ['Erdemİr', 'Ecem'], ['Kahraman', 'Fatİh Ahmet'], ['GÜner', 'Hatİce Rahmet']]",['Journal Article'],"['COVID', 'Ddimerfibrinogen', 'ratio', 'SARSCOV', 'hematological', 'markers', 'neutrophillymphocyte', 'ratio', 'predictive', 'value', 'systemic', 'immuneinflammation', 'index']",now,2010-now

Information on age, sex, hematological investigations, including systemic inflammation-based markers and nutritional assessment biomarkers, and imaging parameters of skeletal muscle mass and visceral adipose tissue were retrieved from the patients' medical records. The efficiency of the Cox, Weibull, and standardized exponential models were compared using hazard ratios and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).RESULTS: Results from the Weibull, Cox, and standardized exponential model analyses indicated that low skeletal muscle mass, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS), and the requirement of biliary drainage were associated with the highest risk of death, followed by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and the presence of ascites. The AIC value from the four significant parameters was lowest for the Weibull-exponential distribution (222.3) than that of the Cox (653.7) and standardized exponential models (265.7). We developed a model for estimating the 1-year survival probability using the Weibull-exponential distribution.CONCLUSIONS: Low-skeletal muscle index, PS, requirement of biliary drainage, CEA levels, and presence of ascites are independent factors for predicting poor patient survival after chemotherapy.

To determine the intercellular interactions, we developed an organ-on-chip of the cervical epithelial layer (CE-OOC) composed of two co-culture chambers connected by microchannels, recapitulating the ectocervical and endocervical epithelial layers. Further, we tested the interactions between cells from each distinct region and their contributions in maintaining cervical integrity in response to LPS and TNFα stimulations. The co-culture of ectocervical and endocervical cells facilitated cellular migration of both epithelial cells inside the microchannels. Compared to untreated controls, both LPS and TNFα increased apoptosis, necrosis, and senescence as well as increased pro-inflammatory cytokine productions by cervical epithelial cells. In summary, the CE-OOC established an in vitro model that can recapitulate the ectocervical and the endocervical epithelial regions of the cervix.

Using ASMKO mice, we report that ASM deficiency is associated with a complex inflammatory phenotype characterized by marked accumulation of monocyte-derived CD11b+ macrophages and expansion of airspace/alveolar CD11c+ CD11b- macrophages, both with increased size, granularity, and foaminess. Both the alternative and classical pathways were activated, with decreased in situ phagocytosis of opsonized (Fc-coated) targets, preserved clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis), secretion of Th2 cytokines, increased CD11c+/CD11b+ cells, and more than a twofold increase in lung and plasma proinflammatory cytokines.

In recent years, innate lymphoid cells (ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3) have been discovered. The predominant ILC type found in the lung tissue is group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Upon damage to the airway epithelium mediating the release of epithelial cytokines (TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25) ensued the activation of ILC2 in an antigen-independent manner. Activated ILC2 produces a significant amount of type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13), altogether contributing to type 2 inflammation in the airways.

However, GITRL is not known to modulate the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. In this study, we investigated whether regulating GITRL expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) can prevent asthma and to elucidate its mechanism of action.METHODS: In vivo, the role of GITRL in modulating house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma was assessed in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-shGITRL mice. In vitro, the role of GITRL expression by DCs was evaluated in LV-shGITRL bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) under HDM stimulation. And the direct effect of GITRL was observed by stimulating splenocytes with GITRL protein. The effect of regulating GITRL on CD4+ T cell differentiation was detected. Further, GITRL mRNA in the peripheral blood of asthmatic children was tested.RESULTS: GITRL was significantly increased in HDM-challenged mice. In GITRL knockdown mice, allergen-induced airway inflammation, serum total IgE levels and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were reduced. In vitro, GITRL expression on BMDCs was increased after HDM stimulation. Further, knocking down GITRL on DCs partially restored the balance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells. Moreover, GITRL stimulation in vitro inhibited Treg cell differentiation and promoted Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation. Similarly, GITRL mRNA expression was increased in the peripheral blood from asthmatic children.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel role for GITRL expressed by DCs as a positive regulator of

Despite this, the process by which S. lupi induces cancer in the dog remains poorly understood, and some hypotheses have arisen regarding these possible mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the role of specific ESP from the carcinogenic helminths Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and Schistosoma haematobium in inducing chronic inflammation and cancer in their host's tissues. The parasitic worms Taenia solium, Echinococcus granulosus, Heterakis gallinarum, Trichuris muris and Strongyloides stercoralis, which have less-characterized mechanisms of cancer induction, are also analyzed.

However, previous studies often assess AD patients who have been on medications or other interventions for the disease. Also, simultaneous determination of gut microbiome in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD in a study is rare.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was a gut microbiome alteration in patients newly diagnosed with AD or MCI and whether the degree of gut microbiome alteration was more severe in patients with AD than patients with MCI.METHODS: Fecal samples of 18 patients with AD, 20 patients with MCI, and 18 age-matched healthy controls were collected in the morning for 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. No patient had medications or interventions for AD or MCI before the samples were collected.RESULTS: Although there was no difference in the microbial α-diversity among the three groups, patients with AD or MCI had increased β-diversity compared with healthy controls. Patients with AD had decreased Bacteroides, Lachnospira, and Ruminiclostridium_9 and increased Prevotella at the genus level compared with healthy controls. The changing direction of these genera in patients with MCI was the same as patients with AD. However, Lachnospira was the only genus whose abundance in patients with MCI was statistically significantly lower than healthy controls. Bacteroides, Lachnospira, and Ruminiclostridium_9 were positively associated with better cognitive functions whereas Prevotella was on the contrary when subjects of all three groups were considered. The negative correlation of Prevotella with cognitive functions remained among patients with MCI.CONCLUSION: Patients newly diagnosed with AD or MCI have gut dysbiosis that includes the decrease of potentially protective microbiome, such as Bacteroides, and the increase of microbiome that can promote inflammation, such as Prevotella.

In this study, experiments were performed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of which Astaxanthin inhibiting the microglia M1 activation.MAIN METHODS: BV2 cells and mice were pre-treated with Astaxanthin and treated by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expressions of M1-related factors (pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1 markers) were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot. The target association between miR-31-5p and Numb was explored via luciferase activity assay. MiR-31-5p mimic was transfected into BV2 cells, then the cells were treated with Astaxanthin in combination with LPS. The expression of M1-related factors and Notch pathway-related molecules were measured via RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assay.KEY FINDINGS: Precondition of BV2 cells with Astaxanthin inhibited the expression of M1-related factors triggered by LPS. In addition, Astaxanthin decreased the number of Iba1-positive microglia and downregulated the levels of M1-related factors in hippocampus in LPS-treated mice. Further investigation revealed that Astaxanthin-mediated suppression of M1-related factors levels was reversed by miR-31-5p mimic in BV2 cells stimulated by LPS. Subsequently, we verified that miR-31-5p repressed Numb expression by binding to the 3'-UTR of Numb mRNA. Also, Astaxanthin suppressed the expression of Notch1, Hes1 and Hes5 and improved the expression of Numb in BV2 cells challenged by LPS, but this alteration can be reversed by miR-31-5p mimic.SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated that down-regulating miR-31-5p by Astaxanthin could be a potential therapeutic approach to suppress neuroinflammation via regulating microglia M1 activation.",2021,Astaxanthin M1 activation Notch Numb miR315p,"['The Marine Biomedical Research Institute, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China; Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhanjiang), Zhanjiang 524023, China; The Marine Biomedical Research Institute of Guangdong Zhanjiang, Zhanjiang 524023, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China.', 'The Marine Biomedical Research Institute, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China; Guangdong Key Laboratory for Research and Development of Natural Drugs, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China.', 'The Marine Biomedical Research Institute, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China; Guangdong Key Laboratory for Research and Development of Natural Drugs, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China.

Hence, the present study aimed to fill this gap. Methods: A total of 54 schizophrenia patients with olanzapine or clozapine monotherapy [metabolic syndrome (MetS)/non-MetS patients, 27/27] and 67 healthy subjects were recruited in the present study. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was used, and the plasma levels of SIRT1, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were measured. Results: The results showed that schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine (both MetS and non-MetS groups) had significantly higher plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α compared to normal controls (all P < 0.05). Moreover, the MetS patients exhibited markedly lower plasma levels of SIRT1 and higher plasma levels of IL-6 than non-MetS patients and normal controls (all P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in IL-8 levels between groups. Our correlation analysis showed that SIRT1 was significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in schizophrenia patients. The stepwise logistic regression analysis further identified the IL-6 × SIRT1 (β = -0.463, t = 10.040, P = 0.002) as the influencing factor for the MetS in the patients.

Bioinformatic tools identified miR-214 binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of YKL-40 mRNA. Serum levels of YKL-40 were examined by ELISA, while YKL-40 mRNA and miR-214 was measured by qPCR.RESULTS: The in silico analysis revealed several microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting YKL-40 mRNA, from which miR-214 was selected.

We demonstrate for the first time using intracellular staining, HIF-1α stabilization in neutrophils and endothelial cells in ILD lung biopsies. Hypoxia enhanced both spontaneous (+1.31-fold, p < 0.05) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced (+1.65-fold, p < 0.001) neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, neutrophil adhesion (+8.8-fold, <0.05), and trans-endothelial migration (+1.9-fold, p < 0.05). Hypoxia also increased neutrophil expression of the αM (+3.1-fold, p < 0.001) and αX (+1.6-fold, p < 0.01) integrin subunits. Interestingly, NET formation was induced by αMβ2 integrin activation and prevented by cation chelation. Finally, we observed NET-like structures in IPF lung sections and in the BAL from ILD patients, and quantification showed increased cell-free DNA content (+5.5-fold, p < 0.01) and MPO-citrullinated histone H3 complexes (+21.9-fold, p < 0.01) in BAL from ILD patients compared to non-ILD controls. In conclusion, HIF-1α upregulation may augment neutrophil recruitment and activation within the lung interstitium through activation of β2 integrins.

Immune cells form an essential part of the wound as induction of inflammation is a necessary step to elicit tissue healing. Rapid progress in transcriptomic analyses by high-throughput next-generation sequencing has been developed to study gene regulatory network and establish molecular signatures of immune cells that could potentially predict their functional roles in tissue repair and regeneration. However, the identification of cellular heterogeneity especially on the rare cell subsets has been limited in transcriptomic analyses of bulk cell populations. Therefore, genome-wide, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has offered an unprecedented approach to unravel cellular diversity and to study novel immune cell populations involved in tissue repair and regeneration through unsupervised sampling of individual cells without the need to rely on prior knowledge about cell-specific markers. The analysis of gene expression patterns at a single-cell resolution also holds promises to uncover the mechanisms and therefore the development of therapeutic strategy promoting immunoregenerative medicine.

Nonetheless, current medication is only modestly efficacious and associated with significant cardiovascular and systemic side effects. More efficacious and safe drugs are required to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF.AREAS COVERED: In this review, several potential drug targets are discussed including trans-membrane ion channels, intracellular calcium signaling, gap junction signaling, atrial inflammation and fibrosis, and the autonomic nervous system. New tools and methodologies for AF drug development are also reviewed including gene therapy, genome-guided therapy, stem cell technologies, tissue engineering, and optogenetics.EXPERT OPINION: In recent decades, there has been an increased understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of AF. As a result, there is a gradual paradigm shift from focusing only on trans-membrane ion channel inhibition to developing therapeutic agents that target other underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms.

The efficacy of using a tissue expander capsule as an induced vascular bed to prefabricate functional vascularized smooth muscle tissue flaps for bladder reconstruction in a rabbit model was tested. Methods: Skin tissue expanders were inserted into the groin to induce vascularized capsule pouch formation. Smooth muscle cells and endothelial progenitor cells were harvested and cocultured to form pre-vascularized smooth muscle cell sheet. Then repeated transplantation of triple-layer cell sheet grafts onto the vascularized capsular tissue was performed at 2-day intervals to prefabricate functional vascularized smooth muscle tissue flaps. Bladder muscular wall defects were created and repaired by six-layer cell sheet graft (sheet only), capsule flap (capsule only) and vascularized capsule prelaminated with smooth muscle cell sheet (sheet plus capsule). The animals were followed for 3 months after implantation and their bladders were explanted serially. Results: Bladder capacity and compliance were maintained in sheet plus capsule group throughout the 3 months. Tissue bath stimulation demonstrated that contractile responses to carbachol and KCl among the three groups revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Histologically, inflammation was evident in the capsule only group at 1 month and fibrosis was observed in sheet only group at 3 months. The vessel density in capsule only and sheet plus capsule group were significantly higher than in the sheet only group at each time point (p < 0.05). Comparison of the smooth muscle content among the three groups revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results proved that the capsule may serve as an induced vascular bed for vascularized smooth muscle tissue flap prefabrication.

We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MP) among hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19.METHODS: A parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with clinical, epidemiological, and/or radiological suspected COVID-19 at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution) twice daily for 5 days. A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.RESULTS: From 18 April to 16 June 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 were randomized, and 393 were analyzed as mITT, with 194 individuals assigned to MP and 199 to placebo. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 81.3%. The mortality rates at Day 28 were not different between groups. A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years old in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at Day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until Day 7.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04343729.",2021,Brazil SARSCoV2 coronavirus corticosteroid

Data about the training effects with supplemental oxygen in nonhypoxemic patients remains inconclusive. In this study we set out to investigate the training and oxygen effects on inflammatory markers, vascular function, and endothelial progenitor cells in this population of increased cardiovascular risk.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 29 patients with nonhypoxemic COPD performed combined endurance and strength training 3 times a week while breathing medical air or supplemental oxygen for the first 6-week period, and were then reallocated to the opposite gas for the following 6 weeks. Exercise capacity, inflammatory biomarkers, endothelial function (peripheral arterial tone analysis), and endothelial progenitor cells were assessed. Data were also analyzed for a subgroup with endothelial dysfunction (reactive hyperemia index <1.67).RESULTS: Following 12 weeks of exercise training, patients demonstrated a significant improvement of peak work rate and an associated decrease of blood fibrinogen and leptin. Eosinophils were found significantly reduced after exercise training in patients with endothelial dysfunction. In this subgroup, peripheral arterial tone analysis revealed a significant improvement of reactive hyperemia index. Generally, late endothelial progenitor cells were found significantly reduced after the exercise training intervention. Supplemental oxygen during training positively influenced the effect on exercise capacity without impact on inflammation and endothelial function.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled trial in patients with COPD to show beneficial effects of exercise training not only on exercise capacity, but also on systemic/eosinophilic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.",2021,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease EPC Endothelial dysfunction Eosinophilic inflammation Supplemental oxygen,"['University Institute of Sports Medicine, Prevention and Rehabilitation, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria; Research Institute for Molecular Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria; Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Italy.', 'University Institute of Sports Medicine, Prevention and Rehabilitation, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria; Research Institute for Molecular Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria; Division of Cardiology, University Heart Centre, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.', 'University Clinic of Pneumology, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria.', 'University Clinic of Pneumology, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kepler-University-Hospital, Johannes-Kepler-University, Linz, Austria.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Italy.', 'University Clinic of Pneumology, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria.', 'University Institute of Sports Medicine, Prevention and Rehabilitation, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria; Research Institute for Molecular Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, Paracelsus Medical University of Salzburg, Austria.

Since unstable atherosclerotic plaques frequently do not cause hemodynamically significant blood flow restriction, conventional stress imaging tests cannot depict the vulnerable, high-risk for rupture atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, molecular imaging techniques targeting specific pathophysiologic features related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture mechanism, hold promise for precise and individualized treatment strategies of CD. In the current report, we describe in a patient diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, the selective uptake of 68Ga-DOATATE by an atherosclerotic lesion in the thoracic aorta.

Here, we analyzed CD39 and CD73 on different lymphocyte populations in a small cohort of COVID-19 patients and in healthy individuals. We describe a significantly lower level of expression of CD73 on cytotoxic lymphocyte populations, including CD8+ T, natural killer T (NKT), and natural killer (NK) cells, during COVID-19. Interestingly, the decrease of CD73 on CD8+ T cells and NKT cells correlated with serum ferritin levels. Furthermore, we observed distinct functional differences between the CD73+ and CD73- subsets of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells with regard to cytokine/toxin secretion. In COVID-19 patients, the majority of the CD73-CD8+ T cells were capable of secreting granzyme B, perforin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) or interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). To conclude, in this first study of CD39 and CD73 expression of lymphocytes in COVID-19, we show that CD8+ T cells and NKT cells lacking CD73 possess a significantly higher cytotoxic effector functionality compared to their CD73+ counterparts.

Intrapulmonary lymph nodes can be identified on CT as perifissural nodules (PFN). We investigated the association between the number and size of PFNs and measures of COPD severity.Materials and Methods: CT images were obtained from COPDGene. 50 subjects were randomly selected per GOLD stage (0 to 4), GOLD-unclassified, and never-smoker groups and allocated to either ""Healthy,"" ""Mild,"" or ""Moderate/severe"" groups. 26/350 (7.4%) subjects had missing images and were excluded. Supported by computer-aided detection, a trained researcher prelocated non-calcified opacities larger than 3 mm in diameter. Included lung opacities were classified independently by two radiologists as either ""PFN,"" ""not a PFN,"" ""calcified,"" or ""not a nodule""; disagreements were arbitrated by a third radiologist. Ordinal logistic regression was performed as the main statistical test.Results: A total of 592 opacities were included in the observer study. A total of 163/592 classifications (27.5%) required arbitration. A total of 17/592 opacities (2.9%) were excluded from the analysis because they were not considered nodular, were calcified, or all three radiologists disagreed. A total of 366/575 accepted nodules (63.7%) were considered PFNs. A maximum of 10 PFNs were found in one image; 154/324 (47.5%) contained no PFNs.

Recent researches have pointed out a link among RDW, chronic kidney disease, and inflammation. We sought to investigate the prognostic value of baseline RDW in patients with peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis (PDAP).Methods: Our study included 337 peritonitis episodes experienced by 202 patients who were undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at a single center from 2013 to 2018. Episodes were categorized according to the tertiles of baseline RDW levels (T1, <13.2%; T2, 13.2-14.3%; T3, >14.3%). Routine logistic regression and generalized estimating equation (GEE) were used to estimate the association between RDW and treatment failure, which was defined as relapse/recurrent episodes, catheter removal, or death during therapy.Results: After adjusting for other potential predictors, RDW exhibited an incremental relationship with the risk of treatment failure. The baseline RDW of T3 indicated a 43% and 52% increased venture of treatment failure in logistic and GEE analyses, respectively, compared with T1. As a continuous variable, the fitting curve based on restricted cubic spiline showed that the relationship was nonlinearly but positively correlated. The multivariate model A (combined RDW with baseline age, albumin, serum ferritin, and duration on CAPD) showed an area under the curve of 0.671 (95% confidence interval, 0.5920.749) for the prediction of treatment failure.Conclusions: A Higher baseline level of RDW was significantly associated with a greater rate of treatment failure among PDAP episodes independent of other potential predictors.",2020,Red blood cell distribution width chronic kidney disease peritoneal dialysis peritoneal dialysisassociated peritonitis,"[""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Shaanxi Provincial Secondary People's Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Renal failure'],['England'],"[['He', 'Peng'], ['Hu', 'Jin-Ping'], ['Li', 'Huan'], ['Tian', 'Xiu-Juan'], ['He', 'Li-Jie'], ['Sun', 'Shi-Ren'], ['Huang', 'Chen']]",['Journal Article'],"['Red', 'blood', 'cell', 'distribution', 'width', 'chronic', 'kidney', 'disease', 'peritoneal', 'dialysis', 'peritoneal', 'dialysisassociated', 'peritonitis']",2010s,2010-now

Unbiased ribonucleic acid sequencing of GIP-stimulated hypothalami revealed that hypothalamic pathways most affected by intracerebroventricular (ICV) GIP stimulation were related to inflammatory-related responses. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that GIP administered either peripherally or centrally, increased proinflammatory-related factors such as Il-6 and Socs3 in the hypothalamus, but not in the cortex of C57BL/6J male mice. Consistently, hypothalamic activation of IκB kinase-β inflammatory signaling was induced by ICV GIP. Further, hypothalamic levels of proinflammatory cytokines and Socs3 were significantly reduced by an antagonistic GIP receptor (GIPR) antibody and by GIPR deficiency. Additionally, centrally administered GIP reduced anorectic actions of insulin in the brain and diminished insulin-induced phosphorylation of Protein kinase B and Glycogen synthase kinase 3β in the hypothalamus.

Recent evidence indicates that fractalkine (FKN) and its receptor CX3CR1 have been linked to inflammatory response in the brain of hypertensive animal models. Here, we investigated the role of CX3CR1-microglia in nitric oxide (NO) generation during chronic inflammation and systemic blood pressure recovery in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS).METHODS: The hypertensive rat model was used to study the role of CX3CR1-microglia in NTS inflammation following hypertension induction by oral administration of 10% fructose water. The systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff method of non-invasive blood pressure. The CX3CR1 inhibitor AZD8797 was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) in the fructose-induced hypertensive rat. Using immunoblotting, we studied the nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway, NO concentration, and the levels of FKN and CX3CR1, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining.RESULTS: The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, FKN, and CX3CR1 were elevated two weeks after fructose feeding. AZD8797 inhibited CX3CR1-microglia, which improved the regulation of systemic blood pressure and NO generation in the NTS. We also found that IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were recovered by AZD8797 addition.CONCLUSION: We conclude that CX3CR1-microglia represses the nNOS signaling pathway and promotes chronic inflammation in fructose-induced hypertension.

Expression of CCR7 was found to be the hallmark of RA synovial fluid (SF) M1 macrophages (MФs) and its levels were potentiated in response to M1 mediating factors and curtailed by M2 mediators in naïve MФs. Intriguingly, although both CCR7 ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, are elevated in RA specimens, only CCL21 was predominately responsible for CCR7's pathological manifestation of RA. Unique subset of MФs differentiated in response to CCL21 stimulation, exhibited upregulation in Th17-polarizing monokines. Moreover, CCL21-activated monokines were capable of differentiating naïve T cells into joint Th17 cells, which also partook in RA osteoclastogenesis. Finally, to conserve chronic inflammation, SF CCL21 amplified RA neovascularization directly and indirectly by promoting RA FLS and MΦs to secrete proangiogenic factors, VEGF and IL-17.

PMs-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RA-FLS was attenuated by pretreatment with antioxidants. Nox-dependent ROS generation led to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, followed by downregulation of microRNA-137. In vivo studies, the joints of rats exposed to PMs revealed synovial fibroblast inflammation under pathologic examination and the expressions of IL-6 and COX-II were obviously increased.

Assessment of fatigue was conducted using a fatigue subscale from the FACIT-F questionnaire. Severity of skin lesions and arthritis was determined with PASI and DAS28, respectively, as well as the number of painful and swollen joints, severity of pain and inflammatory markers.Results: Severe fatigue occurred in 17%, 28%, and 1.6% of patients with psoriasis, PsA and the control group, respectively. Severity of fatigue was significantly higher in patients with PsA as compared to patients with psoriasis (p < 0.0001). In patients with psoriasis and PsA, it decreased along with the duration of psoriasis (r = 0.291, p < 0.05 vs. r = 0.382, p < 0.05, respectively). No significant correlation was found between the duration of PsA and fatigue. After using the linear regression model, severity of fatigue in psoriasis was correlated with the age of patients and the duration of psoriasis, while in PsA, with the duration of psoriasis, PASI, DAS28, CRP and the number of painful joints.Conclusions: The results of this study may indicate the need for routine fatigue examination among people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.",2020,fatigue inflammation psoriasis psoriatic arthritis,"['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Collegium Medicum, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Dermatology, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Clinical Immunology, School of Medicine, Collegium Medicum, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Dermatology, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Clinical Immunology, School of Medicine, Collegium Medicum, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.']",['eng'],['Postepy dermatologii i alergologii'],['Poland'],"[['Krajewska-Włodarczyk', 'Magdalena'], ['Owczarczyk-Saczonek', 'Agnieszka'], ['Placek', 'Waldemar']]",['Journal Article'],"['fatigue', 'inflammation', 'psoriasis', 'psoriatic', 'arthritis']",2010s,2010-now

In the first stage, all experimental animals were divided into 4 groups: 1) intact, 2) with simulated periodontitis, 3) with reproduced periodontitis against the background of reproduced hyperacidic gastritis, 4) with reproduced periodontitis against the background of hyperacid gastritis under the conditions of tobacco smoking. Biochemical studies of gum homogenate with periodontitis in rats were conducted to determine the impact of stomach pathology and tobacco smoke as endogenous and exogenous risk factors. In stage 2, the effectiveness of local therapy with the use of the newly created oral care product and a comparator was studied in rats with reproduced periodontitis against the background of hyperacidic gastritis under the conditions of smoking.Results: In the experimental periodontitis against the background of hyperacidic gastritis under the conditions of tobacco smoking, there were significant changes in the periodontal tissues characteristic of the inflammatory process: the activity of peroxide oxidation of lipid (POL) increased, activity of the antioxidant system decreased, and inflammatory markers increased when nonspecific protection was reduced. Local therapy in the rats using the new ""Apisan"" gel resulted in the correction of certain metabolic disorders, faster elimination of the harmful effects of the damaging factors, and restoration of the condition of periodontal tissues compared with the use of the comparator, the Asepta gel.Conclusion: The therapeutic effectiveness of the new Apisan gel is due to the normalizing effect on the processes of POL, and inflammation and activation of the oral cavity protective systems during inflammatory periodontal disease occurring against the background of a concomitant stomach pathology, hyperacidic gastritis.",2020,Apigel hyperacidic gastritis inflammation periodontitis tobacco smoking,"['Odessa National Medical University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Therapeutic Dentistry, Odessa, Ukraine.', 'Odessa National Medical University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Organization and Economics of Pharmacy, Odessa, Ukraine.', 'Odessa National Medical University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Organization and Economics of Pharmacy, Odessa, Ukraine.', 'Odessa National Medical University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Organization and Economics of Pharmacy, Odessa, Ukraine.', 'Odessa National Medical University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Therapeutic Dentistry, Odessa, Ukraine.', 'Odessa National Medical University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Therapeutic Dentistry, Odessa, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Turkish journal of pharmaceutical sciences'],['Turkey'],"[['Kravchenko', 'Lyudmila'], ['Borisyuk', 'Irina'], ['Fizor', 'Natali'], ['Unhurian', 'Liana'], ['Zolotukhina', 'Elena'], ['Goncharenko', 'Olga']]",['Journal Article'],"['Apigel', 'hyperacidic', 'gastritis', 'inflammation', 'periodontitis', 'tobacco', 'smoking']",2010s,2010-now

Whole transcriptome analysis showed the global profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified 458 DEGs associated with major changes in biological processes of the host cells after infection with 2017 HPAI H7N9 virus versus 2013 LPAI H7N9 virus, mainly including drastically increased defense responses to viruses (e.g. negative regulation of viral gene replication), IFNs related pathways, immune response/native immune response, and inflammatory response. Genes of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathways were found changed remarkably and several highly correlated non-coding RNAs were identified. The results suggested that HPAI H7N9 virus induces stronger immune response and suppressing response than LPAI H7N9. Meanwhile, PD-1/PD-Ls signaling pathways work together in regulating host responses including antiviral defense, lethal inflammation caused by the virus and immune response, thus contribute to the high pathogenicity of 2017H7N9 virus that can be regulated by non-coding RNAs.

We investigated SLE heterogeneity by assessing the expression of three gene sets representative of type I IFN (IFN-I), polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) and plasmablast (PB) signatures in a well-characterized, multidisciplinary cohort of SLE patients. We further assessed whether individual gene products could be representative of these three signatures.METHODS: Whole blood, serum and clinical data were obtained from 140 SLE individuals. Gene expression was assessed by NanoString technology, using a panel of 37 probes to compute six IFN-I, one PMN and one PB scores. Protein levels were measured by ELISA.RESULTS: Depending on the score, 45-50% of SLE individuals showed high IFN-I gene expression. All six IFN-I scores were significantly associated with active skin involvement, and two of six were associated with arthritis. IFN-induced Mx1 protein (MX1) level was correlated with IFN-I score (P < 0.0001) and associated with a similar clinical phenotype. In all, 25% of SLE individuals showed high PMN gene expression, associated with SLE fever, serositis, leukopoenia and glucocorticoid use. PB gene expression was highly affected by immunosuppressant agents, with no association with SLE features. Combined IFN-I and PMN gene scores were significantly associated with high disease activity and outperformed anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q autoantibody and complement levels for predicting SLE activity.CONCLUSION: IFN-I and PMN gene scores segregate with distinct SLE clinical features, and their combination may identify high disease activity.

A direct coculture model of primary human myofibroblasts (MyoFB) and M-CSF-differentiated macrophages (M-Mɸ) in fibrillar three-dimensional Collagen I (Coll I) matrices is developed to study intercellular interactions. The coculture experiments reveal the number of M-Mɸ regulated MyoFB dedifferentiation in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of MyoFB decreases in dependence of the number of cocultured M-Mɸ, even in the presence of MyoFB-inducing transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1 ). Gene expression analysis of matrix proteins (collagen I, collagen III, ED-A-fibronectin) confirms the results of an altered MyoFB phenotype. Additionally, M-Mɸ is shown to be the main source of secreted cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is suggested to affect MyoFB dedifferentiation.

Excessive proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and over-expression of angiogenic factors play a crucial role in pannus formation and joint destruction in RA. Clarification of the role of cholinergic agonists in modulation of inflammation and immune system reactions is progressively ongoing. In this study, the anti-angiogenic effect of two cholinergic agonists, nicotine and ARR17779, on human FLS, and monocytic cell lines (U937) was evaluated.Experimental approach: The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and treated with different doses of nicotine and ARR17779 in the presence of TNF-α, LPS, and IFN-γ. After 48 h, cell number was counted in different groups. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized and the expression of VEGF and MMPs has been evaluated by real-time PCR using specific primers and probes. VEGF was assayed in U937 cell line supernatant using ELISA method.Key results: Both nicotine and ARR17779 inhibited FLS and U937 cell proliferation. Cholinergic agonists reduced the expression of MMPs and VEGF. VEGF level in supernatant of U937 cells treated with cholinergic agonists was also reduced.Conclusion and implications: Our results suggest that cholinergic agonists can modulate pathological conditions related to pannus formation in in-vitro conditions.

Mey. (Korean ginseng) has been widely used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes mellitus for thousands of years. It also plays a key role in health maintenance owing to its anti-oxidant and anti-fatigue properties, and is quite popular as a dietary supplement.AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to offer a complementary and alternative medicine to manage the diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which causes long-term damage to the renal structure. We also investigated the regulation of the autophagy mechanism, which is the underlying the pathogenesis of DKD.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on DKD was evaluated using human kidney proximal tubular cells and streptozotocin (STZ)-treated Sprague-Dawley rat models. In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the proteins related to fibrosis and autophagy. This was followed by in vivo experiments involving rats treated with single intraperitoneal administration of STZ (60 mg/kg) and then with KRG solution orally for 4 weeks. Proteins related to renal injury, fibrosis, and autophagy were determined by immunoblotting. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Sirius red, and immunostaining were processed for histological studies.RESULTS: KRG diminished the levels of metabolic measurements and blood parameters. Western blotting showed a decreased expression of proteins, such as TGF-β1, KIM1, and AGE, which are responsible for renal inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Histological studies also supported these results and revealed that the KRG-treated groups recovered from renal injury and fibrosis. Furthermore, the autophagy marker, LC3, was upregulated, whereas p62 was downregulated. The levels of proteins related to the autophagy mechanism, such as ATG7, increased, while mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) decreased with the KRG treatment and exhibited accelerated autophagy compared to the STZ alone group.CONCLUSIONS: KRG can suppress renal inflammation, injury, and fibrosis by blocking TGF-β1 activation and can induce cellular autophagy.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical initiators of innate immune responses; as such, they orchestrate inflammation following hepatic injury. Here, we subjected EP3-deficient (Ptger3-/- ) and wild-type (WT) mice to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and demonstrate that signaling via the prostaglandin E (PGE) receptor EP3 in DCs regulates macrophage plasticity during liver repair. Compared with WT mice, Ptger3-/- mice showed delayed liver repair accompanied by reduced expression of hepatic growth factors and accumulation of Ly6Clow reparative macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). MoDCs were recruited to the boundary between damaged and undamaged liver tissue in an EP3-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of moDCs from Ptger3-/- mice resulted in impaired repair, along with increased numbers of Ly6Chigh inflammatory macrophages. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) up-regulated expression of genes related to a reparative macrophage phenotype when co-cultured with moDCs; this phenomenon was dependent on EP3 signaling. In the presence of an EP3 agonist, interleukin (IL)-13 derived from moDCs drove BMMs to increase expression of genes characteristic of a reparative macrophage phenotype.

Macrophages are critical for the initiation and resolution of the inflammatory phase during wound repair. In diabetes, macrophages display a sustained inflammatory phenotype in late wound healing characterized by elevated production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α. Previous studies have shown that an altered epigenetic program directs diabetic macrophages toward a proinflammatory phenotype, contributing to a sustained inflammatory phase. Males absent on the first (MOF) is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that has been shown be a coactivator of TNF-α signaling and promote NF-κB-mediated gene transcription in prostate cancer cell lines. Based on MOF's role in TNF-α/NF-κB-mediated gene expression, we hypothesized that MOF influences macrophage-mediated inflammation during wound repair. We used myeloid-specific Mof-knockout (Lyz2Cre Moffl/fl) and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice to determine the function of MOF in diabetic wound healing. MOF-deficient mice exhibited reduced inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Furthermore, we found that wound macrophages from DIO mice had elevated MOF levels and higher levels of acetylated histone H4K16, MOF's primary substrate of HAT activity, on the promoters of inflammatory genes. We further identified that MOF expression could be stimulated by TNF-α and that treatment with etanercept, an FDA-approved TNF-α inhibitor, reduced MOF levels and improved wound healing in DIO mice.

This transition between reversible pain and the establishment of chronic neuropathic pain is poorly understood. We examined the role of persistent inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the long-term maintenance of mechanical allodynia; an index of neuropathic pain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent chronic constriction injury (CCI), spared nerve injury (SNI) or sham surgery. Both CCI and SNI animals displayed robust mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral paw at 7 d post-surgery; however, only SNI animals maintained mechanical allodynia at 42 d post-surgery. DRGs were extracted at 7 d or 42 d post-surgery to assess inflammation via rt-qPCR or immunohistochemistry to measure colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) expression, satellite glial cell (SGC) activation, presence of Iba1 positive macrophages and interleukin1 β (IL-1β) mRNA levels. Whereas DRGs from SNI animals continued to display inflammatory markers at 42 d, those from CCI animals did not. Moreover, the level of allodynia displayed by each individual animal correlated with the extent of DRG inflammation. These data support the hypothesis that the amount of CSF1 immunoreactivity and the persistence of inflammation in ipsilateral DRGs contribute to the difference between transient and persistent mechanical allodynia observed in the CCI and SNI models. We also suggest that feedback loops involving cytokines and neurotransmitters may contribute to increased DRG activity in chronic neuropathic pain.

Model mice were randomly divided into blank control group (Control), commercial chitosan membrane Control group (Film) and mXG thermosensitive hydrogel group (Hydrogel), each group contained 16 rats.In the Hydrogel group, 1 mL 4% (m/V) mXG solution was smeared on the wound surface of abdominal wall and the cecum, then closed the abdomen after gel was formed (3 min).In the Film group, 2 cm×3 cm chitosan anti-adhesion Film was applied onto the wound surface of the abdominal wall before abdominal closure.In the Control group, 1 mL normal saline was applied onto the wound surface of abdominal wall and the cecum before abdominal closure.On 7 and 14 d after the operation, rats'abdominal cavity was opened by surgery to examine and score the adhesion grade between the abdominal wall and the cecum, with double-blind design.Meanwhile, the adhesion tissue or wound tissue was taken and stained by HE, Masson and Van Gieson to histological evaluate the anti-adhesion effect.The expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was determined by immunohistochemical staining as well. Another group of 12 SD rat models were subjected to mXG thermosensitive hydrogel intervention.At the 1 and 6 weeks postoperation, rats main organs such as heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were taken for histological examination with HE staining for the purpose of evaluation the toxicity of mXG in vivo.RESULTS: Adhesion grade evaluation results showed that Film group rats occurred mild adhesion, Control group rats occurred severe adhesion, while in Hydrogel group hardly rats occured adhesion, and the differences were statistically significant(P < 0.05). Histological results showed that the Hydrogel group rats recovered well at 7 d after surgery.In healing wound tissue, no mutated tissue was observed, but a certain degree of inflammatory cell infiltration was still existed. At 14 d after surgery, the inflammation cells in the wound were significantly reduced, and the healing tissue containing only a small amount of collagen fibers under the neonatal mesothelial layer.But the other two groups showed different degrees of adhesion at the 7 and 14 d post surgery.Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of TGF-β1 and CTGF in the Hydrogel group were both weaker than those in the other groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

In this study, we analyzed the immunomodulatory properties of mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs after their intravitreal delivery to the inflammatory environment in the eye, caused by the application of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ. The intravitreal administration of these cytokines induces an increased expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1α, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, TNF-α and vascular endothelial growth factor in the retina. However, a significant decrease in the expression of genes for all these pro-inflammatory molecules was observed after the intravitreal injection of MSCs. We further showed that an increased infiltration of the retina with immune cells, mainly with macrophages, which was observed after pro-inflammatory cytokine application, was significantly reduced after the intravitreal application of MSCs. The similar immunosuppressive effects of MSCs were also demonstrated in vitro in cultures of cytokine-stimulated retinal explants and MSCs.

For the latter, male gender, seropositivity for rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), as well as older age, has been suggested, among others, as risk factors.

There are three clinical forms described: relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the most common initial presentation (85%) among which, if not treated, about half will transform, into the secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and the primary progressive MS (PPMS) (15%) that is directly progressive without superimposed clinical relapses. Inflammation is present in all subsets of MS. The relapsing/remitting form could represent itself a particular interest for the study of inflammation resolution even though it remains incomplete in MS. Successful resolution of acute inflammation is a highly regulated process and dependent on mechanisms engaged early in the inflammatory response that are scarcely studied in MS. Moreover, recent classes of disease-modifying treatment (DMTs) that are effective against RRMS act by re-establishing the inflammatory imbalance, taking advantage of the pre-existing endogenous suppressor. In this review, we will discuss the active role of regulatory immune cells in inflammation resolution as well as the role of tissue and non-hematopoietic cells as contributors to inflammation resolution.

Modulation of this channel by intracellular signaling pathways has therefore important clinical implications. We investigated the modulation of recombinant and natively expressed TRPM8 by the Src kinase, which is known to be involved in cancer pathophysiology and inflammation. Human TRPM8 expressed in HEK293T cells is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated by Src which is expressed either heterologously or endogenously. Src action on TRPM8 potentiates its activity, as treatment with PP2, a selective Src kinase inhibitor, reduces both TRPM8 tyrosine phosphorylation and cold-induced channel activation. RNA interference directed against the Src kinase diminished the extent of PP2-induced functional downregulation of TRPM8, confirming that PP2 acts mainly through Src inhibition. Finally, the effect of PP2 on TRPM8 cold activation was reproduced in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, and this action was antagonized by the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, confirming that TRPM8 activity is sensitive to the cellular balance between tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.

Tristetraprolin (TTP), an mRNA binding protein, plays a role in regulating the inflammatory factors, recognizing specific sequences on the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs. TTP activity depends on its phosphorylation state: the unphosphorylated TTP degrades pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs; on the contrary, the phosphorylated TTP fails to destabilize mRNAs furthering their expression. The phospho-TTP forms a complex with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This binding could be one of the factors that promote intestinal inflammation as a cause of disease progression.AIM: To assess if TTP phosphorylation has a role in paediatric IBD.METHODS: The study was carried out on a cohort of paediatric IBD patients. For each patient enrolled, a specimen of inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa was collected. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted on macrophages differentiated from blood samples of the same patients. Macrophages from healthy donors' blood were used as controls. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting analyses were performed to observe the formation of the phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex. In the same samples TNF-α expression was also evaluated as major factor of the pro-inflammatory activity.RESULTS: In this work we studied indirectly the phosphorylation of TTP through the binding with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. In inflamed and non-inflamed colon mucosa of IBD paediatric patients immunoblot assay demonstrated a higher expression of the TTP in inflamed samples respect to the non-inflamed; the co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 protein showed the same trend of expression. In the TNF-α gene expression analysis higher levels of the cytokine in inflamed tissues compared to controls were evident. The same experiments were conducted on macrophages from IBD paediatric patients and healthy controls. The immunoblot results demonstrated a high expression of both TTP and co-immunoprecipitated 14-4-3 protein in IBD-derived macrophages in comparison to healthy donors. TNF-α protein levels from macrophages lysates showed the same trend of expression in favour of IBD paediatric patients compared to healthy controls.CONCLUSION: In this work, for the first time, we describe a relation between phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex and IBD.

Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD remains to be defined.METHODS: We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of the KLB mutant.RESULTS: The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with an increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB downregulation obtained by the expression of a KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and upregulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that the KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.LAY SUMMARY: Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

We sought to determine predictors of urethroplasty failure in men with lichen sclerosus urethral stricture disease by evaluating protein expression profiles.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urethral tissue was excised from patients with lichen sclerosus who were undergoing urethroplasty of urethral stricture disease at a single institution. A tissue microarray was created with cores from each sample. Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare protein expression related to inflammation, cell cycle disruption, oxidative stress, hormone receptor status and infection. Stricture recurrence was defined by the need for a subsequent unanticipated procedure for urethral stricture disease.RESULTS: We evaluated 50 men with lichen sclerosus urethral stricture disease, including 31 with successful reconstruction and 19 with recurrent stricture. Recurrent strictures expressed lower levels of several inflammatory markers and had a lower Ki-67 mitotic index and significantly higher vascular endothelial growth factor levels than nonrecurrent strictures.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study to use tissue protein expression to identify risk factors for urethroplasty failure among men with lichen sclerosus urethral stricture disease. Our findings suggest that recurrent lichen sclerosus strictures demonstrate a suppressed inflammatory response, a decreased cell turnover rate, and poor oxygenation and nutrient delivery.

The activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) initiated Txnip degradation, while no further Txnip degradation was observed in TLR2-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. NADPH oxidase-regulated NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory activation were induced and accompanied by Txnip degradation during GAS infection.

Redox, hematological, hemochemical, immunologic and virological indexes were determined.RESULTS: Both HIV groups had significant differences in global indexes of damage and antioxidant status (p<0.05) with respect to the supposedly healthy individual group. HCV-HIV group showed a significantly higher damage (total hydroperoxide and advanced oxidation protein products) compared to the control and HIV groups (p<0.05). The overall modification of the redox indexes showed that 72% of individuals with simultaneous detrimental differences were related to HCV-HIV condition.CONCLUSIONS: These results corroborate that oxidative stress occurs in the HIV condition and also during HCV-HIV co-infection, with different molecular changes of follow-up indexes.

We also found that KLF14 could restored appropriate cellular lipid homeostasis and inflammatory responses via negatively regulating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in THP1-derived macrophages through miR-27a. In addition, gypenosides (GP), a KLF14 activator, delayed the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice.CONCLUSIONS: KLF14 plays an antiatherogenic role via the miR-27a-dependent down-regulation of LPL and subsequent inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine secretion and lipid accumulation.",2019,Atherosclerosis Inflammation Krüppellike factor Lipoprotein lipase Macrophage MicroRNA,"['Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Key Laboratory for Atherosclerology of Hunan Province, Medical Research Center, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China; Clinical Anatomy & Reproductive Medicine Application Institute, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Key Laboratory for Atherosclerology of Hunan Province, Medical Research Center, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China; Department of Pathophysiology, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Key Laboratory for Atherosclerology of Hunan Province, Medical Research Center, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Key Laboratory for Atherosclerology of Hunan Province, Medical Research Center, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Clinical Anatomy & Reproductive Medicine Application Institute, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Clinical Anatomy & Reproductive Medicine Application Institute, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Key Laboratory for Atherosclerology of Hunan Province, Medical Research Center, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, Cumming School of Medicine, The University of Calgary, Health Sciences Center, 3330 Hospital Dr NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2N 4N1; Key Laboratory of Molecular Targets & Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Group on the Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Molecular Target & Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Key Laboratory for Atherosclerology of Hunan Province, Medical Research Center, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.

Therefore the demographic profile and cardiometabolic, renal and liver function of an HIV-infected South African population were profiled from 2005 to 2015.METHODS: The study included 117 HIV-infected and 131 uninfected controls that were examined at baseline, five and 10 years.RESULTS: Mortality rate declined from 24% (2005-2010) to 0% (2010-2015) after the introduction of ART. Longitudinal increases in C-reactive protein (p = 0.002), alanine transaminase (p = 0.006) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (p = 0.046) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (p < 0.001) were seen only in the HIV-infected group. This group also showed increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p < 0.001) and total cholesterol (p < 0.001) levels and decreased triglyceride:HDL-C (p = 0.011) levels.

However, its contribution and relationship to malaria mortality across different age groups has not been well investigated. Previous studies in a health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) platform in western Kenya quantified the contribution of incidence and entomological inoculation rates (EIR) to mortality. The study assessed the relationship between outcomes of malaria parasitaemia surveys and mortality across age groups.METHODS: Parasitological data from annual cross-sectional surveys from the Kisumu HDSS between 2007 and 2015 were used to determine malaria parasite prevalence (PP) and clinical malaria (parasites plus reported fever within 24 h or temperature above 37.5 °C). Household surveys and verbal autopsy (VA) were used to obtain data on all-cause and malaria-specific mortality. Bayesian negative binomial geo-statistical regression models were used to investigate the association of PP/clinical malaria with mortality across different age groups. Estimates based on yearly data were compared with those from aggregated data over 4 to 5-year periods, which is the typical period that mortality data are available from national demographic and health surveys.RESULTS: Using 5-year aggregated data, associations were established between parasite prevalence and malaria-specific mortality in the whole population (RRmalaria = 1.66; 95% Bayesian Credible Intervals: 1.07-2.54) and children 1-4 years (RRmalaria = 2.29; 1.17-4.29). While clinical malaria was associated with both all-cause and malaria-specific mortality in combined ages (RRall-cause = 1.32; 1.01-1.74); (RRmalaria = 2.50; 1.27-4.81), children 1-4 years (RRall-cause = 1.89; 1.00-3.51); (RRmalaria = 3.37; 1.23-8.93) and in older children 5-14 years (RRall-cause = 3.94; 1.34-11.10); (RRmalaria = 7.56; 1.20-39.54), no association was found among neonates, adults (15-59 years) and the elderly (60+ years). Distance to health facilities, socioeconomic status, elevation and survey year were important factors for all-cause and malaria-specific mortality.CONCLUSION: Malaria parasitaemia from cross-sectional surveys was associated with mortality across age groups over 4 to 5 year periods with clinical malaria more strongly associated with mortality than parasite prevalence. This effect was stronger in children 5-14 years compared to other age-groups.

Because of these pro-cellular effects, an imbalance in GM-CSF production/signaling may lead to harmful inflammatory conditions. In this context, GM-CSF has a pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases that are dependent on cellular immune responses such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Using our own immune system cells, we can direct the immune cell function and develop desired response against a certain threat. Immunotherapy applications have been suggested against tumors, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. Vaccination can be considered as one of the best known example of immunotherapy. Infectious agent's signature molecular structures are introduced to the immune cells together with the adjuvants that further activate the immune cells to mount a proper immune response and memory. Immunotherapy and vaccine formulations are in constant need of a library of immunomodulatory reagents that can be applied depending on the target. In order to expand the number of immunomodulatory reagents that can find medicinal applications, our group has been testing unique chemical structures on the immune system cells, especially macrophages. Schiff base complexes are known for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. In this study, we used previously characterized Schiff base complexes with different metal conjugations. These molecules had differential immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory potentials on macrophages in vitro depending on the type of the conjugated metal. After light exposure, these complexes changed their characteristics and became powerful anti-inflammatory complexes. Due to their possible antimicrobial potentials, we also tested their activities against gram negative and gram positive bacteria. All of the complexes exerted antimicrobial activities which were not light responsive.

Signaling responses that involve TNF-α are context dependent and capable of stimulating pathways promoting both cell death and survival. TNF-α treatment has been investigated as part of a combined therapy for acute myeloid leukemia due to its modifying effects on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediated differentiation into granulocytes. To investigate the interaction between cellular differentiation and TNF-α, we performed RNA-sequencing on two forms of the human HL-60/S4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line treated with TNF-α. The ATRA-differentiated granulocytic form of HL-60/S4 cells had an enhanced transcriptional response to TNF-α treatment compared to the undifferentiated promyelocytes. The observed TNF-α responses included differential expression of cell cycle gene sets, which were generally upregulated in TNF-α treated promyelocytes, and downregulated in TNF-α treated granulocytes. This is consistent with TNF-α induced cell cycle repression in granulocytes and cell cycle progression in promyelocytes. Moreover, we found evidence that TNF-α treatment of granulocytes shifts the transcriptome toward that of a macrophage. We conclude that TNF-α treatment promotes a divergent transcriptional program in promyelocytes and granulocytes. TNF-α promotes cell cycle associated gene expression in promyelocytes.

To induce T1DM, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg·kg-1). Treadmill exercise was performed for six weeks, five days/week. HbA1c was estimated, MSTN mRNA expression in skeletal muscle was measured, and plasma MSTN and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) were determined. Results revealed a significant decrease of HbA1c and plasma inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β) followed by a significant decrease of plasma and skeletal muscle MSTN in diabetic trained rats versus non-diabetic untrained and diabetic untrained rats after the experimental period. Moreover, in diabetic untrained and diabetic trained rats, a significantly positive correlation (change versus change) of plasma MSTN with HbA1c and plasma IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β was found. In conclusion, this study indicated that aerobic exercise training by a decrease of HbA1c and plasma IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β could decrease MSTN levels in plasma and skeletal muscle in T1DM.

If the disease occurs postpartum or neonatally, physicians should consider transplacental transmission of pathogenic maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG)-autoantibodies, and both mother and child should be included in the diagnostic work up. If the disorder is suspected in childhood, early immunoserological testing and skin biopsies for direct immunofluorescence analyses are recommended for the correct diagnosis and subsequently for the right choice of treatment. First-line recommendations are nonhalogenated topical steroids, followed by oral dapsone. All therapies require preliminary examinations, e. g. enzyme-activity testing (as is glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase in dapsone treatment). In refractory cases, further treatment choices like high-dose intravenous immunoglobins, plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption or targeted therapies like anti-CD20 autoantibody therapies are indicated.

Macrophages are usually found adjacent to amyloid, suggesting their involvement in the formation and/or degradation of the amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that lipid membranes accelerate the fibrillation of different amyloid proteins.METHODS: Using an experimental mouse model of AA amyloidosis, we compared the amyloidogenic effect of liposomes and/or amyloid-enhancing factor (AEF). Inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of silver nitrate followed by intravenous injection of liposomes and/or AEF to accelerate amyloid formation.RESULTS: We showed that liposomes accelerate amyloid formation in inflamed mice, but the amyloidogenic effect of liposomes was weaker compared with AEF. Regardless of the induction method, amyloid deposits were mainly found in the marginal zones of the spleen and coincided with the depletion of marginal zone macrophages, while red pulp macrophages and metallophilic marginal zone macrophages proved insensitive to amyloid deposition.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased intracellular lipid content facilitates AA amyloid fibril formation and show that the mouse model of AA amyloidosis is a suitable system for further mechanistic studies.",2019,AA amyloidosis Amyloid lipid membrane liposomes macrophages,"['a Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.', 'b Departments of Clinical Pathology and Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.', 'c Molecular and Immunological Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.', 'a Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.', 'd Department of Medical Cell Biology , Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.', 'a Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.', 'b Departments of Clinical Pathology and Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.']",['eng'],['Amyloid : the international journal of experimental and clinical investigation : the official journal of the International Society of Amyloidosis'],['England'],"[['Vahdat Shariat Panahi', 'Aida'], ['Hultman', 'Per'], ['Öllinger', 'Karin'], ['Westermark', 'Gunilla T'], ['Lundmark', 'Katarzyna']]",['Journal Article'],"['AA', 'amyloidosis', 'Amyloid', 'lipid', 'membrane', 'liposomes', 'macrophages']",2010s,2010-now

However, the pathophysiology of sepsis can make CLvcm prediction less accurate. Clearance of hydrophilic antibiotics is disturbed by organ dysfunction, and hemoglobin levels are negatively correlated with sequential organ function assessment scores. We investigated whether hemoglobin levels are associated with CLvcm in sepsis patients.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients treated with VCM in the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Nihon University Itabashi Hospital between 2005 and 2015. We enrolled 72 patients after exclusion of patients who received renal replacement therapy or surgery, had a change in hemoglobin levels more than 2 g/dL or received an erythrocyte infusion during the interval between initial VCM administration and measurement of initial trough levels, had a serum baseline creatinine level of ≥ 2 mg/dL, or were under 18 years old.RESULTS: Enrolled patients consisted of 13 non-sepsis patients and 59 sepsis patients. In sepsis patients, although CLvcm was correlated with CrCl in HGB ≥ 9 group as well as in non-sepsis patients, its correlation was not observed in HGB CONCLUSION: Lower hemoglobin levels influence a relationship between CLvcm and CrCl in sepsis patients.

Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within a therapeutic time window of 4.5 h after stroke onset constitutes the only existing treatment. Beyond this time window, rtPA worsens BBB breakdown. Canonical Wnt pathway induces BBB formation and maturation during ontogeny. We hypothesized that the pathway is required to maintain BBB functions after stroke; thus, its activation might improve rtPA therapy. Therefore, we first assessed pathway activity in the brain of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Next, we evaluated the effect of pathway deactivation early after stroke onset on BBB functions. Finally, we assessed the impact of pathway activation on BBB breakdown associated to delayed administration of rtPA. Our results show that pathway activity is induced predominately in endothelial cells early after ischemic stroke. Early deactivation of the pathway using a potent inhibitor, XAV939, aggravates BBB breakdown and increases hemorrhagic transformation incidence. On the other hand, pathway activation using a potent activator, 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6-BIO), reduces the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation associated to delayed rtPA administration by attenuating BBB breakdown via promotion of tight junction formation and repressing endothelial basal permeability independently of rtPA proteolytic activity.

However, the role of these necroptotic regulators in diabetes remains unknown. Here we sought to delineate the role of MLKL in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D).METHODS: We first analyzed the expression of key necroptotic regulators in obese/diabetic mouse models. We then utilized MLKL knockout (MLKL-/-) mice to evaluate the effects of MLKL on obesity-induced metabolic complications. We further determined the consequences of MLKL inhibition on hepatic insulin signaling and explored the underlying mechanism. Finally, we assessed the potential therapeutic effects of necroptotic inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), in ob/ob mice.RESULTS: In wild-type or obese mice (ob/ob, db/db, or diet-induced obesity), MLKL was increased in certain obesity-associated tissues, particularly in the liver. Whole-body deficiency of MLKL prevented obesity-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Inhibition of MLKL or other key necroptotic regulators enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. MLKL modulated insulin-stimulated PI(3,4,5)P3 production in liver cells but did not affect the expression of inflammatory genes in vitro and in vivo.

In the present study, we fused the major mite allergen Derp2 to FlaB and compared the therapeutic effects of the Derp2-FlaB fusion protein with those of a mixture of Derp2 and FlaB in a Derp2-induced mouse asthma model.METHODS: BALB/c mice sensitized with Derp2 + HDM were treated with Derp2, a Derp2 plus FlaB (Derp2 + FlaB) mixture, or the Derp2-FlaB fusion protein 3 times at 1-week intervals. Seven days after the final treatment, the mice were challenged intranasally with Derp2, and airway responses and Derp2-specific immune responses were evaluated.RESULTS: The Derp2-FlaB fusion protein was significantly more efficacious in reducing airway hyperresponsiveness, lung eosinophil infiltration, and Derp2-specific IgE than the Derp2 + FlaB mixture.CONCLUSIONS: The Derp2-FlaB fusion protein showed a strong anti-asthma immunomodulatory capacity, leading to the prevention of airway inflammatory responses in a murine disease model through the inhibition of Th2 responses. These findings suggest that the Derp2-FlaB fusion protein would be a promising vaccine candidate for HDM-mediated allergic asthma therapy.",2019,Asthma Derp2 FlaB flagellin Tolllike receptor 5 fusion protein,"['Clinical Vaccine R&D Center and Department of Microbiology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Laboratory of In Vivo Molecular imaging, Institute for Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Clinical Vaccine R&D Center and Department of Microbiology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Dental Therapeutics, School of Dentistry, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea. jhrhee@chonnam.ac.kr.', 'Clinical Vaccine R&D Center and Department of Microbiology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Allergy, asthma & immunology research']","['United States', 'Korea South']","[['Tan', 'Wenzhi'], ['Zheng', 'Jin Hai'], ['Duong', 'Tra My Nu'], ['Koh', 'Young Il'], ['Lee', 'Shee Eun'], ['Rhee', 'Joon Haeng']]",['Journal Article'],"['Asthma', 'Derp', 'FlaB', 'flagellin', 'Tolllike', 'receptor', 'fusion', 'protein']",2010s,2010-now

However, the specific effect of TanIIA on macrophage polarization has not been reported. In this study, it was revealed that TanIIA might play a pivotal role in macrophage polarization. As our results indicated, cell morphology was changed in RAW264.7 cells which were treated with LPS or LPS/TanIIA (0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM). Subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured by ELISA kits. Furthermore, TanIIA enhanced the expression of M2 macrophage markers (Arg1 and FIZZ1) and decreased the expression of markers associated with M1 macrophage polarization (iNOS and IL-1β). Increased expression of CD206 was also detected by flow cytometry in TanIIA-treated groups. Mechanistically, it was revealed that TanIIA modulated macrophage polarization by ameliorating mitochondrial function and regulating TLR4-HMGB1/CEBP-β pathway. In addition, increased expression of miR-155 was observed in RAW264.7 cells incubated with LPS and were effectively inhibited by TanIIA. Taken together, it was suggested that TanIIA inhibits inflammatory response and promotes macrophage polarization toward an M2 phenotype, which provides new evidence for the anti-inflammation activity of TanIIA.",2019,TLR4HMGB1CEBPβ pathway TanIIA cell elongation macrophage polarization mitochondrial function,"['Medical Experiment Center, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 314 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China.', 'Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 312 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China.', 'Medical Experiment Center, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 314 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China.', 'Medical Experiment Center, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 314 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Medical Experiment Center, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 314 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China.', 'Medical Experiment Center, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 314 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China.', 'Medical Experiment Center, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 314 An Shan Xi Road, Nan Kai District, Tianjin, 300193, China. fgw1005@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Inflammation'],['United States'],"[['Gao', 'Shan'], ['Wang', 'Yili'], ['Li', 'Dan'], ['Guo', 'Yuying'], ['Zhu', 'Meifeng'], ['Xu', 'Shixin'], ['Mao', 'Jingyuan'], ['Fan', 'Guanwei']]",['Journal Article'],"['TLRHMGBCEBPβ', 'pathway', 'TanIIA', 'cell', 'elongation', 'macrophage', 'polarization', 'mitochondrial', 'function']",2010s,2010-now
